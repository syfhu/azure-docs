<sup>1</sup> The maximum disk throughput (IOPS or MBps) possible with a DS series VM may be limited by the number, size and striping of the attached disk(s).

## A-series - compute-intensive instances

ACU: 225

The A8-A11 and H-series sizes are also known as *compute-intensive instances*. The hardware that runs these sizes is designed and optimized for compute-intensive and network-intensive applications, including high-performance computing (HPC) cluster applications, modeling, and simulations. The A8-A11 series uses Intel Xeon E5-2670 @ 2.6 GHZ and the H-series uses Intel Xeon E5-2667 v3 @ 3.2 GHz.  This article provides information about the number of vCPUs, data disks, and NICs as well as storage throughput and network bandwidth for each size in this grouping. 

| Size | vCPU | Memory: GiB | Temp storage (HDD): GiB | Max data disks | Max data disk throughput: IOPS | Max NICs|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard_A8 <sup>1</sup> |8 |56 |382 |32 |32x500 |2 |
| Standard_A9 <sup>1</sup> |16 |112 |382 |64 |64x500 |4 |
| Standard_A10 |8 |56 |382 |32 |32x500 |2  |
| Standard_A11 |16 |112 |382 |64 |64x500 |4 |

<sup>1</sup>For MPI applications, dedicated RDMA backend network is enabled by FDR InfiniBand network, which delivers ultra-low-latency and high bandwidth.

| Standard_A1 |1 |1.75 |70 |2 |2x500 |2 / 500  |

<sup>1</sup> The A0 size is over-subscribed on the physical hardware. For this specific size only, other customer deployments may impact the performance of your running workload. The relative performance is outlined below as the expected baseline, subject to an approximate variability of 15 percent.

### Standard A0 - A4 using CLI and PowerShell
In the classic deployment model, some VM size names are slightly different in CLI and PowerShell:

* Standard_A0 is ExtraSmall 
* Standard_A1 is Small
* Standard_A2 is Medium
* Standard_A3 is Large
* Standard_A4 is ExtraLarge

## Basic A

The basic tier sizes are primarily for development workloads and other applications that don't require load balancing, auto-scaling, or memory-intensive virtual machines.

|Size – Size\Name | vCPU |Memory|NICs (Max)|Max temporary disk size |Max. data disks (1023 GB each)|Max. IOPS (300 per disk)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|A0\Basic_A0|1|768 MB|2| 20 GB|1|1x300|
|A1\Basic_A1|1|1.75 GB|2| 40 GB |2|2x300|
|A2\Basic_A2|2|3.5 GB|2| 60 GB|4|4x300|
