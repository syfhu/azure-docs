## Provision the solution

If you haven't already provisioned the remote monitoring preconfigured solution in your account:

1. Sign in to [azureiotsuite.com][lnk-azureiotsuite] using your Azure account credentials, and click **+** to create a solution.
2. Click **Select** on the **Remote monitoring** tile.
3. Enter a **Solution name** for your remote monitoring preconfigured solution.
4. Select the **Region** and **Subscription** you want to use to provision the solution.
5. Click **Create Solution** to begin the provisioning process. This process typically takes several minutes to run.

### Wait for the provisioning process to complete
1. Click the tile for your solution with **Provisioning** status.
2. Notice the **Provisioning states** as Azure services are deployed in your Azure subscription.
3. Once provisioning completes, the status changes to **Ready**.
4. Click the tile to see the details of your solution in the right-hand pane.

> [!NOTE]
