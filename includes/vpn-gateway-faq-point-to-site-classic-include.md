This FAQ applies to P2S connections using the classic deployment model.

### What client operating systems can I use with Point-to-Site?

The following client operating systems are supported:

* Windows 7 (32-bit and 64-bit)
* Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit only)
* Windows 8 (32-bit and 64-bit)
* Windows 8.1 (32-bit and 64-bit)
* Windows Server 2012 (64-bit only)
* Windows Server 2012 R2 (64-bit only)
* Windows 10

### Can I use any software VPN client for Point-to-Site that supports SSTP?

No. Support is limited only to the Windows operating system versions listed above.

### How many VPN client endpoints can I have in my Point-to-Site configuration?

We support up to 128 VPN clients to be able to connect to a virtual network at the same time.

### Can I use my own internal PKI root CA for Point-to-Site connectivity?

Yes. Previously, only self-signed root certificates could be used. You can still upload 20 root certificates.

### Can I traverse proxies and firewalls using Point-to-Site capability?

Yes. We use SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol) to tunnel through firewalls. This tunnel will appear as an HTTPs connection.

### If I restart a client computer configured for Point-to-Site, will the VPN automatically reconnect?

By default, the client computer will not reestablish the VPN connection automatically.

### Does Point-to-Site support auto-reconnect and DDNS on the VPN clients?

Auto-reconnect and DDNS are currently not supported in Point-to-Site VPNs.

### Can I have Site-to-Site and Point-to-Site configurations coexist for the same virtual network?

Yes. Both these solutions will work if you have a RouteBased VPN type for your gateway. For the classic deployment model, you need a dynamic gateway. We do not support Point-to-Site for static routing VPN gateways or gateways using the `-VpnType PolicyBased` cmdlet.

### Can I configure a Point-to-Site client to connect to multiple virtual networks at the same time?

Yes, it is possible. But the virtual networks cannot have overlapping IP prefixes and the Point-to-Site address spaces must not overlap between the virtual networks.

### How much throughput can I expect through Site-to-Site or Point-to-Site connections?

It's difficult to maintain the exact throughput of the VPN tunnels. IPsec and SSTP are crypto-heavy VPN protocols. Throughput is also limited by the latency and bandwidth between your premises and the Internet.
