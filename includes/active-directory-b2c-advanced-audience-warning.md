> Custom policies are designed primarily to address complex scenarios. For most scenarios, we recommend that you use Azure Active Directory B2C [built-in policies](..\articles\active-directory-b2c\active-directory-b2c-reference-policies.md). Built-in policies are easier to set up for your configuration.
