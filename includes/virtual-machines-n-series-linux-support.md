## Supported distributions and drivers

### NVIDIA CUDA drivers

NVIDIA CUDA drivers for NC, NCv2, NCv3, and ND-series VMs (optional for NV-series) are supported only on the Linux distributions listed in the following table. CUDA driver information is current at time of publication. For the latest CUDA drivers, visit the [NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) website. Ensure that you install or upgrade to the latest CUDA drivers for your distribution. 

> [!TIP]
> As an alternative to manual CUDA driver installation on a Linux VM, you can deploy an Azure [Data Science Virtual Machine](../articles/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview.md) image. The DSVM editions for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or CentOS 7.4 pre-install NVIDIA CUDA drivers, the CUDA Deep Neural Network Library, and other tools.

| Distribution | Driver |
| --- | -- | 
| Ubuntu 16.04 LTS<br/><br/> Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 or 7.4<br/><br/> CentOS-based 7.3 or 7.4, CentOS-based 7.4 HPC | NVIDIA CUDA 9.1, driver branch R390 |

### NVIDIA GRID drivers

Microsoft redistributes NVIDIA GRID driver installers for NV-series VMs used as virtual workstations or for virtual applications. Install only these GRID drivers on Azure NV VMs, only on the distributions listed in the following table. These drivers include licensing for GRID Virtual GPU Software in Azure.

| Distribution | Driver |
| --- | -- |
| Ubuntu 16.04 LTS<br/><br/>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 or 7.4<br/><br/>CentOS-based 7.3 or 7.4 | NVIDIA GRID 6.0, driver branch R390|



> [!WARNING] 
> Installation of third-party software on Red Hat products can affect the Red Hat support terms. See the [Red Hat Knowledgebase article](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1067).
