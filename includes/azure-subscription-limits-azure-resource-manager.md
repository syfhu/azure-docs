<sup>1</sup>Default limits vary by offer Category Type, such as Free Trial, Pay-As-You-Go, and series, such as Dv2, F, G, etc.

<sup>2</sup>This includes both Standard and Premium storage accounts. If you require more than 200 storage accounts, make a request through [Azure Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/faq/). The Azure Storage team will review your business case and may approve up to 250 storage accounts.

<sup>3</sup>You can apply an unlimited number of tags per subscription. The number of tags per resource or resource group is limited to 15. Resource Manager only returns a [list of unique tag name and values](/rest/api/resources/tags#Tags_List) in the subscription when the number of tags is 10,000 or less. However, you can still find a resource by tag when the number exceeds 10,000.  

<sup>4</sup>These features are no longer required with Azure Resource Groups and the Azure Resource Manager.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to emphasize that virtual machine cores have a regional total limit as well as a regional per size series (Dv2, F, etc.) limit that are separately enforced.  For example, consider a subscription with a US East total VM core limit of 30, an A series core limit of 30, and a D series core limit of 30.  This subscription would be allowed to deploy 30 A1 VMs, or 30 D1 VMs, or a combination of the two not to exceed a total of 30 cores (for example, 10 A1 VMs and 20 D1 VMs).
