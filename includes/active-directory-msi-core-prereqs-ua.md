If you're unfamiliar with MSI, check out the [Managed Service Identity overview](~/articles/active-directory/managed-service-identity/overview.md), and **be sure to review the [difference between a system-assigned and user-assigned MSI](~/articles/active-directory/managed-service-identity/overview.md#how-does-it-work)**. If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before continuing.
