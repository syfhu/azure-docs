Organizations have large-scale computing needs. These Big Compute workloads include engineering design and analysis, financial risk calculations, image rendering, complex modeling, Monte Carlo simulations, and more. 

Use the Azure cloud to efficiently run compute-intensive Linux and Windows workloads, from parallel batch jobs to traditional HPC simulations. Run your HPC and batch workloads on Azure infrastructure, with your choice of compute services, grid managers, Marketplace solutions, and vendor-hosted (SaaS) applications. Azure provides flexible solutions to distribute work and scale to thousands of VMs or cores and then scale down when you need fewer resources. 



## Solution options



* **Do-it-yourself solutions**
    * Set up your own cluster environment in Azure virtual machines or [virtual machine scale sets](../articles/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-overview.md). 
    * Lift and shift an on-premises cluster, or deploy a new cluster in Azure for additional capacity. 
    * Use Azure Resource Manager templates to deploy leading [workload managers](#workload-managers), infrastructure, and [applications](#hpc-applications). 
    * Choose [HPC and GPU VM sizes](#hpc-and-gpu-sizes) that include specialized hardware and network connections for MPI or GPU workloads. 
    * Add [high performance storage](#hpc-storage) for I/O-intensive workloads.
* **Hybrid solutions**
    * Extend your on-premises solution to offload ("burst") peak workloads to Azure infrastructure
    * Use cloud compute on-demand with your existing [workload manager](#workload-manager).
    * Take advantage of [HPC and GPU VM sizes](#hpc-and-gpu-sizes) for MPI or GPU workloads.
* **Big Compute solutions as a service**
    * Develop custom Big Compute solutions and workflows using [Azure Batch](#azure-batch) and related [Azure services](#related-azure-services).
    * Run Azure-enabled engineering and simulation solutions from vendors including [Altair](http://www.altair.com/), [Rescale](https://www.rescale.com/azure/), and [Cycle Computing](https://cyclecomputing.com/) (now [joined with Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2017/08/15/microsoft-acquires-cycle-computing-accelerate-big-computing-cloud/)).
    * Use a [Cray supercomputer](https://www.cray.com/solutions/supercomputing-as-a-service/cray-in-azure) as a service hosted in Azure.
* **Marketplace solutions**
    * Use the scale of [HPC applications](#hpc-applications) and [solutions](#marketplace-solutions) offered in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/).

## HPC and GPU VM sizes
Azure offers a range of sizes for [Linux](../articles/virtual-machines/linux/sizes.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json) and [Windows](../articles/virtual-machines/windows/sizes.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json) VMs, including sizes designed for compute-intensive workloads. For example, H16r and H16mr VMs can connect to a high throughput back-end RDMA network. This cloud network can improve the performance of tightly coupled parallel applications running under [Microsoft MPI](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb524831.aspx) or Intel MPI. 

N-series VMs feature NVIDIA GPUs designed for compute-intensive or graphics-intensive applications including artificial intelligence (AI) learning and visualization.

## Azure Batch
[Batch](../articles/batch/batch-technical-overview.md) is a platform service for running large-scale parallel and high-performance computing (HPC) applications efficiently in the cloud. Azure Batch schedules compute-intensive work to run on a managed pool of virtual machines, and can automatically scale compute resources to meet the needs of your jobs. 

SaaS providers or developers can use the Batch SDKs and tools to integrate HPC applications or container workloads with Azure, stage data to Azure, and build job execution pipelines.
