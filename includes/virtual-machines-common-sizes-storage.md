Storage optimized VM sizes offer high disk throughput and IO, and are ideal for Big Data, SQL, and NoSQL databases. This article provides information about the number of vCPUs, data disks and NICs as well as storage throughput and network bandwidth for each size in this grouping. 

The Ls-series offers up to 32 vCPUs, using the [Intel® Xeon® processor E5 v3 family](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/xeon/xeon-e5-solutions.html). The Ls-series gets the same CPU performance as the G/GS-Series and comes with 8 GiB of memory per vCPU.  

## Ls-series

ACU: 180-240
 
| Size          | vCPU | Memory: GiB | Temp storage (SSD) GiB | Max data disks | Max temp storage throughput: IOPS / MBps | Max uncached disk throughput: IOPS / MBps | Max NICs / Expected network bandwidth (Mbps) | 
|---------------|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------| 
| Standard_L4s   | 4    | 32   | 678   | 16    | 20,000 / 200   | 5,000 / 125        | 2 / 4,000  | 
| Standard_L8s   | 8    | 64   | 1,388 | 32   | 40,000 / 400   | 10,000 / 250       | 4 / 8,000  | 
| Standard_L16s  | 16   | 128  | 2,807 | 64   | 80,000 / 800   | 20,000 / 500       | 8 / 16,000 | 
| Standard_L32s <sup>1</sup> | 32   | 256  | 5,630 | 64   | 160,000 / 1,600   | 40,000 / 1,000     | 8 / 20,000 | 
 

The maximum disk throughput possible with Ls-series VMs may be limited by the number, size, and striping of any attached disks. For details, see [Premium Storage: High-performance storage for Azure virtual machine workloads](../articles/virtual-machines/windows/premium-storage.md). Ls-series VMs are targeted at workloads with high local storage use and typically only use attached disks for initial loading and logging, as caching is ineffective in these cases the Ls-series does not support host caching for attached disks, disks must be attached in uncached mode. 

<sup>1</sup> Instance is isolated to hardware dedicated to a single customer.

## Size table definitions

- Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When comparing disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB
- Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
- Ls-series data disks cannot operate in cached mode, the host cache mode must be set to **None**.
- If you want to get the best performance for your VMs, you should limit the number of data disks to 2 disks per vCPU.
- **Expected network bandwidth** is the maximum aggregated [bandwidth allocated per VM type](../articles/virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput.md) across all NICs, for all destinations. Upper limits are not guaranteed, but are intended to provide guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on a variety of factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, see [Optimizing network throughput for Windows and Linux](../articles/virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth.md). To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, it may be necessary to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, see [How to reliably test for virtual machine throughput](../articles/virtual-network/virtual-network-bandwidth-testing.md).
