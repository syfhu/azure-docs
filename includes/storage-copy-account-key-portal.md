## Copy your credentials from the Azure portal

The sample application needs to authenticate access to your storage account. To authenticate, you provide the application with your storage account credentials in the form of a connection string. To view your storage account credentials:

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Locate your storage account.
3. In the **Settings** section of the storage account overview, select **Access keys**. Your account access keys appear, as well as the complete connection string for each key.
4. Note the name of your storage account, which you will need to provide to authenticate.   
5. Find the **Key** value under **key1**, and click the **Copy** button to copy the account key.
