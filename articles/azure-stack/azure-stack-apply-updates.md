# Apply updates in Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems*

As an Azure Stack operator, you can apply Microsoft update packages for Azure Stack by using the Update tile in the administrator portal. You must download the Microsoft update package, import the package files to Azure Stack, and then install the update package. 

## Download the update package

When a Microsoft update package for Azure Stack is available, download the package to a location that's reachable from Azure Stack, and review the package contents. An update package typically consists of the following files:

- A self-extracting *PackageName*.exe file. This file contains the payload for the update, for example the latest cumulative update for Windows Server.   
- Corresponding *PackageName*.bin files. These files provide compression for the payload that's associated with the *PackageName*.exe file. 
- A Metadata.xml file. This file contains essential information about the update, for example the publisher, name, prerequisite, size, and support path URL.

## Import and install updates

The following procedure shows how to import and install update packages in the administrator portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We strongly recommend that you notify users of any maintenance operations, and that you schedule normal maintenance windows during non-business hours as much as possible. Maintenance operations may affect both user workloads and portal operations.

1. In the administrator portal, select **More services**. Then, under the **Data + Storage** category, select **Storage accounts**. (Or, in the filter box, start typing **storage accounts**, and select it.)

8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 for the *PackageName*.bin and Metadata.xml files. Do not import the Supplemental Notice.txt file if included.
9. When done, you can review the notifications (bell icon in the top-right corner of the portal). The notifications should indicate that the upload has completed. 
10. Navigate back to the Update tile on the dashboard. The tile should indicate that an update is available. Click the tile to review the newly added update package.
11. To install the update, select the package that's marked as **Ready** and either right-click the package and select **Update now**, or click the **Update now** action near the top.
12. When you click the installing update package, you can view the status in the **Update run details** area. From here, you can also click **Download full logs** to download the log files.
13. When the update completes, the Update tile shows the updated Azure Stack version.
