# Quota types in Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

[Quotas](azure-stack-plan-offer-quota-overview.md#plans) define the limits of resources that a user subscription can provision or consume. For example, a quota might allow a user to create up to five VMs. Each resource can have its own types of quotas.

| --- | --- | --- |
| Max number of virtual machines | 20 | The maximum number of virtual machines that a subscription can create in this location. |
| Max number of virtual machine cores | 50 | The maximum number of cores that a subscription can create in this location (for example, an A3 VM has four cores). |
| Max number of availability sets | 10 | The maximum number of availability sets that can be created in this location. |
| Max number of virtual machine scale sets | 20 | The maximum number of virtual machine scale sets that can be created in this location. |
