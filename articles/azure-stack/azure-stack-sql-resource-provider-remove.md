# Remove the SQL resource provider

Before you remove the SQL resource provider, you must remove all the provider dependencies. You'll also need a copy of the deployment package that was used to install the resource provider.

There are several cleanup tasks to do before you run the _DeploySqlProvider.ps1_ script to remove the resource provider.
The tenants are responsible for the following cleanup tasks:

* Delete all their databases from the resource provider. (Deleting the tenant databases doesn't delete the data.)
* Unregister from the resource provider namespace.

The administrator is responsible for the following cleanup tasks:

* Deletes the hosting servers from the SQL resource provider.
* Deletes any plans that reference the SQL resource provider.
* Deletes any quotas that are associated with the SQL resource provider.

## To remove the SQL resource provider

1. Verify that you've removed all the existing SQL resource provider dependencies.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Uninstalling the SQL resource provider will proceed even if dependent resources are currently using the resource provider.
  
2. Get a copy of the SQL resource provider binary and then run the self-extractor to extract the contents to a temporary directory.

3. Open a new elevated PowerShell console window and change to the directory where you extracted the SQL resource provider binary files.

4. Run the DeploySqlProvider.ps1 script using the following parameters:

    * **Uninstall**. Removes the resource provider and all associated resources.
    * **PrivilegedEndpoint**. The IP address or DNS name of the privileged endpoint.
    * **CloudAdminCredential**. The credential for the cloud administrator, necessary to access the privileged endpoint.
    * **AzCredential**. The credential for the Azure Stack service admin account. Use the same credentials that you used for deploying Azure Stack.
