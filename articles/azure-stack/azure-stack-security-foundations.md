# Azure Stack infrastructure security posture

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems*

Security considerations and compliance regulations are among the main drivers for using hybrid clouds. Azure Stack was designed for these scenarios, and it is important to understand the controls already in place when adopting Azure Stack.

In Azure Stack, there are two security posture layers that coexist. The first layer comprises the Azure Stack infrastructure, which goes from the hardware components all the way up to the Azure Resource Manager, and includes the Administrator and the Tenant portals. The second layer consists of the workloads that tenants create, deploy, and manage and includes things like virtual machines or App Services web sites.  

## Security approach
Azure Stack was designed with a security posture to defend against modern threats, and was built to meet the requirements from the major compliance standards. As a result, the security posture of the Azure Stack infrastructure is built on two pillars:

 - **Assume Breach.**  
Starting from the assumption that the system has already been breached, focus on *detecting and limiting the impact of breaches* versus only trying to prevent attacks. 
 - **Hardened by Default.**  
Since the infrastructure runs on well-defined hardware and software, we *enable, configure, and validate all the security features* by default.



Because Azure Stack is delivered as an integrated system, the security posture of the Azure Stack infrastructure is defined by Microsoft. Just like in Azure, tenants are responsible for defining the security posture of their tenant workloads. This document provides foundational knowledge on the security posture of the Azure Stack infrastructure.

## Data at rest encryption
All Azure Stack infrastructure and tenant data is encrypted at rest using Bitlocker. This encryption protects against physical loss or theft of Azure Stack storage components. 

## Data in transit encryption
The Azure Stack infrastructure components communicate using channels encrypted with TLS 1.2. Encryption certificates are self-managed by the infrastructure. 

All external infrastructure endpoints, such as the REST endpoints or the Azure Stack portal, support TLS 1.2 for secure communications. Encryption certificates, either from a third party or your enterprise Certificate Authority, must be provided for those endpoints. 

While self-signed certificates can be used for these external endpoints, Microsoft strongly advises against using them. 

## Secret management
Azure Stack infrastructure uses a multitude of secrets, like passwords, to function. Most of them are automatically rotated frequently, because they are Group Managed Service accounts, which rotate every 24 hours.

The remaining secrets that are not Group Managed Service accounts can be rotated manually with a script in the Privileged Endpoint.

## Code integrity
Azure Stack makes use of the latest Windows Server 2016 security features. One of them is Windows Defender Device Guard, which provides application whitelisting, and ensures that only authorized code runs within the Azure Stack infrastructure. 

Authorized code is signed by either Microsoft or the OEM partner, and it is included in the list of allowed software that is specified in a policy defined by Microsoft. In other words, only software that has been approved to run in the Azure Stack infrastructure can be executed. Any attempt to execute unauthorized code is blocked and an audit is generated.

The Device Guard policy also prevents third-party agents or software from running in the Azure Stack infrastructure.

## Credential Guard
Another Windows Server 2016 security feature in Azure Stack is Windows Defender Credential Guard, which is used to protect Azure Stack infrastructure credentials from Pass-the-Hash and Pass-the-Ticket attacks.

## Antimalware
Every component in Azure Stack (both Hyper-V hosts and Virtual Machines) is protected with Windows Defender Antivirus.

In connected scenarios, antivirus definition and engine updates are applied multiple times a day. In disconnected scenarios, antimalware updates are applied as part of monthly Azure Stack updates. See [update Windows Defender Antivirus on Azure Stack](azure-stack-security-av.md) for more information.

## Constrained administration model
Administration in Azure Stack is controlled through the use of three entry points, each with a specific purpose: 
1. The [Administrator Portal](azure-stack-manage-portals.md) provides a point-and-click experience for daily management operations.
2. Azure Resource Manager exposes all the management operations of the Administrator Portal via a REST API, used by PowerShell and Azure CLI. 
3. For specific low-level operations, for example data center integration or support scenarios, Azure Stack exposes a PowerShell endpoint called [Privileged Endpoint](azure-stack-privileged-endpoint.md). This endpoint exposes only a whitelisted set of cmdlets and it is heavily audited.

## Network controls
Azure Stack infrastructure comes with multiple layers of network Access Control List(ACL). The ACLs prevent unauthorized access to the infrastructure components and limit infrastructure communications to only the paths that are required for its functioning. 

Network ACLs are enforced in three layers:
1.  Top of Rack switches
2.  Software Defined Network
3.  Host and VM operating system firewalls
