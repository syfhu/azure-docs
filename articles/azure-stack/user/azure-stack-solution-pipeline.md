# Tutorial: deploy apps to Azure and Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

Learn how to deploy an application to Azure and Azure Stack using a hybrid continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.

In this tutorial, you'll create a sample environment to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Initiate a new build based on code commits to your Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) repository.
> * Automatically deploy your app to global Azure for user acceptance testing.
> * When your code passes testing, automatically deploy the app to Azure Stack.

## Benefits of the hybrid delivery build pipe

Continuity, security, and reliability are key elements of application deployment. These elements are essential to your organization and critical to your development team. A hybrid CI/CD pipeline enables you to consolidate your build pipes across your on-premises environment and the public cloud. A hybrid delivery model also lets you change deployment locations without changing your application.

Other benefits to using the hybrid approach are:

* You can maintain a consistent set of development tools across your on-premises Azure Stack environment and the Azure public cloud.  A common tool set makes it easier to implement CI/CD patterns and practices.
* Apps and services deployed in Azure or Azure Stack are interchangeable and the same code can run in either location. You can take advantage of on-premises and public cloud features and capabilities.

To learn more about CI and CD:

* [What is Continuous Integration?](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-continuous-integration/)
* [What is Continuous Delivery?](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-continuous-delivery/)

## Prerequisites

You need to have components in place to build a hybrid CI/CD pipeline. The following components will take time to prepare:

* An Azure OEM/hardware partner can deploy a production Azure Stack. All users can deploy the Azure Stack Development Kit (ASDK).
* An Azure Stack Operator must also: deploy the App Service, create plans and offers, create a tenant subscription, and add the Windows Server 2016 image.

>[!NOTE]
>If you already have some of these components deployed, make sure they meet the all the requirements before you start this tutorial.

This tutorial assumes that you have some basic knowledge of Azure and Azure Stack. To learn more before starting the tutorial, read the following articles:

* [Introduction to Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-azure/)
* [Azure Stack Key Concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-key-features)

### Azure requirements

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
* Create a [Web App](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-web-overview) in Azure. Make note of the Web App URL, you need to use it in the tutorial.

### Azure Stack requirements

* Use an Azure Stack integrated system or deploy the Azure Stack Development Kit (ASDK). To deploy the ASDK:
    * The [Tutorial: deploy the ASDK using the installer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/asdk/asdk-deploy) gives detailed deployment instructions.
    * Use the [ConfigASDK.ps1](https://github.com/mattmcspirit/azurestack/blob/master/deployment/ConfigASDK.ps1 ) PowerShell script to automate ASDK post-deployment steps.

    > [!Note]
    > The ASDK installation takes approximately seven hours to complete, so plan accordingly.

 * Deploy [App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-app-service-deploy) PaaS services to Azure Stack.
 * Create [Plan/Offers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-plan-offer-quota-overview) in Azure Stack.
 * Create a [tenant subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-subscribe-plan-provision-vm) in Azure Stack.
 * Create a Web App in the tenant subscription. Make note of the new Web App URL for later use.
 * Deploy VSTS Virtual Machine in the tenant subscription.
* Provide a Windows Server 2016 image with .NET 3.5 for a virtual machine (VM). This VM will be built on your Azure Stack as a private build agent.

### Developer tool requirements

* Create a [VSTS workspace](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/setup-admin/team-services/sign-up-for-visual-studio-team-services). The sign-up process creates a project named **MyFirstProject**.
* [Install Visual Studio 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio) and [sign-in to VSTS](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/setup-admin/team-services/connect-to-visual-studio-team-services).
* Connect to your project and [clone it locally](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/git/gitquickstart).

 > [!Note]
 > Your Azure Stack environment needs the correct images syndicated to run Windows Server and SQL Server. It must also have App Service deployed.

## Prepare the private build and release agent for Visual Studio Team Services integration

### Prerequisites

Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) authenticates against Azure Resource Manager using a Service Principal. VSTS must have the **Contributor** role to provision resources in an Azure Stack subscription.

The following steps describe what's required to configure authentication:

1. Create a Service Principal, or use an existing Service Principal.
2. Create Authentication keys for the Service Principal.
3. Validate the Azure Stack Subscription via Role-Based Access Control to allow the Service Principal Name (SPN) to be part of the Contributorâ€™s role.
4. Create a new Service Definition in VSTS using the Azure Stack endpoints and SPN information.

### Create a Service Principal

Refer to the [Service Principal Creation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications) instructions to create a service principal, and then choose **Web App/API** for the Application Type.

### Create an access key

A Service Principal requires a key for authentication. Use the following steps to generate a key.

1. From **App registrations** in Azure Active Directory, select your application.

    ![Select the application](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_01.png)

2. Make note of the value of **Application ID**. You will use that value when configuring the service endpoint in VSTS.

    ![Application ID](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_02.png)

3. To generate an authentication key, select **Settings**.

    ![Edit app settings](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_03.png)

4. To generate an authentication key, select **Keys**.

    ![Configure key settings](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_04.png)

5. Provide a description for the key, and set the duration of the key. When done, select **Save**.

    ![Key description and duration](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_05.png)

    After you save the key, the key **VALUE** is displayed. Copy this value because you can't get this value later. You provide the **key value** with the application ID to sign in as the application. Store the key value where your application can retrieve it.

    ![Key VALUE](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_06.png)

### Get the tenant ID

As part of the service endpoint configuration, VSTS requires the **Tenant ID** that corresponds to the AAD Directory that your Azure Stack stamp is deployed to. Use the following steps to get the Tenant ID.

1. Select **Azure Active Directory**.

    ![Azure Active Directory for tenant](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_07.png)

2. To get the tenant ID, select **Properties** for your Azure AD tenant.

    ![View tenant properties](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_08.png)

3. Copy the **Directory ID**. This value is your tenant ID.

    ![Directory ID](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_09.png)

### Grant the service principal rights to deploy resources in the Azure Stack subscription

To access resources in your subscription, you must assign the application to a role. Decide which role represents the best permissions for the application. To learn about the available roles, see [RBAC: Built in Roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).

You can set the scope at the level of the subscription, resource group, or resource. Permissions are inherited to lower levels of scope. For example, adding an application to the Reader role for a resource group means it can read the resource group and any of its resources.

1. Navigate to the level of scope you wish to assign the application to. For example, to assign a role at the subscription scope, select **Subscriptions**.

    ![Select Subscriptions](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_10.png)

2. In **Subscription**, select Visual Studio Enterprise.

    ![Visual Studio Enterprise](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_11.png)

3. In Visual Studio Enterprise, select **Access Control (IAM)**.

    ![Access Control (IAM)](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_12.png)

4. Select **Add**.

    ![Add](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_13.png)

5. In **Add permissions**, select the role you that you want to assign to the application. In this example, the **Owner** role.

    ![Owner role](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_14.png)

6. By default, Azure Active Directory applications aren't displayed in the available options. To find your application, you must provide its name in the **Select** field to search for it. Select the app.

    ![App search result](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_16.png)

7. Select **Save** to finish assigning the role. You see your application in the list of users assigned to a role for that scope.

### Role-Based Access Control

â€ŽAzure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) provides fine-grained access management for Azure. By using RBAC, you can control the level of access that users need to do their jobs. For more information about Role-Based Access Control, see [Manage Access to Azure Subscription Resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal?toc=%252fazure%252factive-directory%252ftoc.json).

### VSTS Agent Pools

Instead of managing each agent separately, you can organize agents into agent pools. An agent pool defines the sharing boundary for all agents in that pool. In VSTS, agent pools are scoped to the VSTS account, which means that you can share an agent pool across team projects. To learn more about agent pools, see [Create Agent Pools and Queues](https://docs.microsoft.com/vsts/build-release/concepts/agents/pools-queues?view=vsts).

### Add a Personal Access Token (PAT) for Azure Stack

Create a Personal Access Token to access VSTS.

1. Sign in to your VSTS account and select your account profile name.
2. Select **Manage Security** to access token creation page.

    ![User sign in](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_17.png)

    ![Select team project](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_18.png)

    ![Add Personal access token](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_18a.png)

    ![Create token](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_18b.png)

3. Copy the token.

    > [!Note]
    > Save the token information. This information isn't stored and won't be shown again when you leave the web page.

    ![Personal access token](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_19.png)

### Install the VSTS build agent on the Azure Stack hosted Build Server

1. Connect to your Build Server that you deployed on the Azure Stack host.
2. Download and Deploy the build agent as a service using your personal access token (PAT) and run as the VM Admin account.

    ![Download build agent](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\010_downloadagent.png)

3. Navigate to the folder for the extracted build agent. Run the **config.cmd** file from an elevated command prompt.

    ![Extracted build agent](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_20.png)

    ![Register build agent](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\000_21.png)

4. When the config.cmd finishes, the build agent folder is updated with additional files. The folder with the extracted contents should look like the following:

    ![Build agent folder update](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\009_token_file.png)

    You can see the agent in VSTS folder.

## Endpoint creation permissions

By creating endpoints, a Visual Studio Online (VSTO) build can deploy Azure Service apps to Azure Stack. VSTS connects to the build agent, which connects to Azure Stack.

![NorthwindCloud sample app in VSTO](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\012_securityendpoints.png)

1. Sign in to VSTO and navigate to the app settings page.
2. On **Settings**, select **Security**.
3. In **VSTS Groups**, select **Endpoint Creators**.

    ![NorthwindCloud Endpoint Creators](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\013_endpoint_creators.png)

4. On the **Members** tab, select **Add**.

    ![Add a member](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\014_members_tab.png)

5. In **Add users and groups**, enter a user name and select that user from the list of users.
6. Select **Save changes**.
7. In the **VSTS Groups** list, select **Endpoint Administrators**.

    ![NorthwindCloud Endpoint Administrators](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\015_save_endpoint.png)

8. On the **Members** tab, select **Add**.
9. In **Add users and groups**, enter a user name and select that user from the list of users.
10. Select **Save changes**.

Now that the endpoint information exists, the VSTS to Azure Stack connection is ready to use. The build agent in Azure Stack gets instructions from VSTS, and then the agent conveys endpoint information for communication with Azure Stack.

## Develop your application build

In this part of the tutorial you'll:

* Add code to a VSTS project.
* Create self-contained web app deployment.
* Configure the continuous deployment process

> [!Note]
 > Your Azure Stack environment needs the correct images syndicated to run Windows Server and SQL Server. It must also have App Service deployed. Review the App Service documentation "Prerequisites" section for Azure Stack Operator Requirements.

Hybrid CI/CD can apply to both application code and infrastructure code. Use [Azure Resource Manager templates like web ](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/) app code from VSTS to deploy to both clouds.

### Add code to a VSTS project

1. Sign in to VSTS with an account that has project creation rights on Azure Stack. The next screen capture shows how to connect to the HybridCICD project.

    ![Connect to a Project](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\017_connect_to_project.png)

2. **Clone the repository** by creating and opening the default web app.

    ![Clone repository](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\018_link_arm.png)

### Create self-contained web app deployment for App Services in both clouds

1. Edit the **WebApplication.csproj** file: Select **Runtimeidentifier** and then add `win10-x64.` For more information, see [Self-contained deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) documentation.

    ![Configure Runtimeidentifier](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\019_runtimeidentifer.png)

2. Use Team Explorer to check the code into VSTS.

3. Confirm that the application code was checked into Visual Studio Team Services.

### Create the build definition

1. Sign in to VSTS with an account that can create a build definition.
2. Navigate to the **Build Web Applicaiton** page for the project.

3. In **Arguments**, add **-r win10-x64** code. This is required to trigger a self-contained deployment with .Net Core.

    ![Add argument build definition](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\020_publish_additions.png)

4. Run the build. The [self-contained deployment build](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) process will publish artifacts that can run on Azure and Azure Stack.

### Use an Azure hosted build agent

Using a hosted build agent in VSTS is a convenient option for building and deploying web apps. Agent maintenance and upgrades are automatically performed by Microsoft Azure, which enables a continuous and uninterrupted development cycle.

### Configure the continuous deployment (CD) process

Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Team Foundation Server (TFS) provide a highly configurable and manageable pipeline for releases to multiple environments such as development, staging, quality assurance (QA), and production. This process can include requiring approvals at specific stages of the application life cycle.

### Create release definition

Creating a release definition is the final step in your application build process. This release definition is used to create a release and deploy a build.

1. Sign in to VSTS and navigate to **Build and Release** for your project.
2. On the **Releases** tab, select **\[ + ]**  and then pick **Create release definition**.

   ![Create release definition](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\021a_releasedef.png)

21. On the **Pipeline** tab, select the **Continuous deployment trigger** icon for the NorthwindCloud Traders-Web artifact and set the **Continuous deployment trigger** to **Enabled**.  Do the same thing for the "NorthwindCloud Traders-Vessel" artifact.

    ![Set continuous deployment trigger](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\121.png)

22. For the Azure Stack environment, select the **Pre-deployment conditions** icon set the trigger to **After release**.

    ![Set pre-deployment conditions trigger](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\122.png)

23. Save all your changes.

> [!Note]
> Some settings for release tasks may have been automatically defined as [environment variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/vsts/build-release/concepts/definitions/release/variables?view=vsts#custom-variables) when you created a release definition from a template. These settings can't be modified in the task settings. However, you can edit these settings in the parent environment items.

## Create a release

Now that you have completed the modifications to the release definition, it's time to start the deployment. To do this, you create a release from the release definition. A release may be created automatically; for example, the continuous deployment trigger is set in the release definition. This means that modifying the source code will start a new build and, from that, a new release. However, in this section you will create a new release manually.

1. On the **Pipeline** tab, open the **Release** drop-down list and choose **Create release**.

    ![Create a release](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\200.png)

2. Enter a description for the release, check to see that the correct artifacts are selected, and then choose **Create**. After a few moments, a banner appears indicating that the new release was created, and the release name is displayed as a link. Choose the link to see the release summary page.

    ![Release creation banner](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\201.png)

3. The release summary page for shows details about the release. In the following screen capture for "Release-2", the **Environments** section shows the **Deployment status** for the Azure as "IN PROGRESS", and the status for Azure Stack is "SUCCEEDED". When the deployment status for the Azure environment changes to "SUCCEEDED", a banner appears indicating that the release is ready for approval. When a deployment is pending or has failed, a blue **(i)** information icon is shown. Hover over the icon to see a pop-up that contains the reason for delay or failure.

    ![Release summary page](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\202.png)

Other views, such as the list of releases, will also display an icon that indicates approval is pending. The pop-up for this icon shows the environment name and more details related to the deployment. It's easy for an administrator see the overall progress of releases and see which releases are waiting for approval.

### Monitor and track deployments

This section shows how you can monitor and track all your deployments. The release for deploying the two Azure App Services websites provides a good example.

1. On the "Release-2" summary page, select **Logs**. During a deployment, this page shows the live log from the agent. The left pane shows the status of each operation in the deployment for each environment.

    You can choose a person icon in the **Action** column for a Pre-deployment or Post-deployment approval to see who approved (or rejected) the deployment, and the message they provided.

2. After the deployment finishes, the entire log file is displayed in the right pane. You can select any **Step** in the left pane to see the log file for an single step, such as "Initialize Job". The ability to see individual logs makes it easier to trace and debug  parts of the overall deployment. You can also **Save** the log file for a step, or **Download all logs as zip**.

    ![Release logs](media\azure-stack-solution-hybrid-pipeline\203.png)

3. Open the **Summary** tab to see general information about the release. This view shows details about the build, the environments it was deployed to, deployment status, and other information about the release.

4. Select an environment link (**Azure** or **Azure Stack**) to see information about existing and pending deployments to a specific environment. You can use these views as a quick way to verify that the same build was deployed to both environments.

5. Open the **deployed production app** in your browser. For example, for the Azure App Services website, open the URL `http://[your-app-name].azurewebsites.net`.
