# Prepare Azure Stack PKI certificates for deployment
The certificate files [obtained from your CA of choice](azure-stack-get-pki-certs.md) must be imported and exported with properties matching Azure Stackâ€™s certificate requirements.


## Prepare certificates for deployment
Use these steps to prepare and validate the Azure Stack PKI certificates: 

### Import the certificate

1.	Copy the original certificate versions [obtained from your CA of choice](azure-stack-get-pki-certs.md) into a directory on the deployment host. 
  > [!WARNING]
  > Do not copy files that have already been imported, exported, or altered in any way from the files provided directly by the CA.

2.	Right-click on the certificate and select **Install Certificate** or **Install PFX** depending on how the certificate was delivered from your CA.

3. In the **Certificate Import Wizard**, select **Local Machine** as the import location. Select **Next**. On the following screen, click next again.

    a. If you are importing a PFX you will be presented with an additional dialog. On the **Private key protection** page, enter the password for your certificate files and then enable the **Mark this key as exportable. This allows you to back up or transport your keys at a later time** option. Select **Next**.
