# Get started with the SharePoint Online connector
Use the SharePoint Online connector to manage SharePoint lists.  

To use [any connector](apis-list.md), you first need to create a logic app. You can get started by [creating a logic app now](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).

## Connect to SharePoint Online
Before your logic app can access any service, you first need to create a *connection* to the service. A [connection](connectors-overview.md) provides connectivity between a logic app and another service.  

### Create a connection to SharePoint Online
> [!INCLUDE [Steps to create a connection to SharePoint](../../includes/connectors-create-api-sharepointonline.md)]


## Use a SharePoint Online trigger
A trigger is an event that can be used to start the workflow defined in a logic app. [Learn more about triggers](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md#logic-app-concepts).  

> [!INCLUDE [Steps to create a SharePoint Online trigger](../../includes/connectors-create-api-sharepointonline-trigger.md)]


## Use a SharePoint Online action
An action is an operation carried out by the workflow defined in a logic app. [Learn more about actions](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md#logic-app-concepts).
