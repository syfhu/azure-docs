# Get started with the Wunderlist connector
Wunderlist is a todo list and task manager to help users complete their tasks.  Whether youâ€™re sharing a grocery list, working on a project, or planning a vacation, Wunderlist makes it easy to capture, share, and complete your list items. Wunderlist instantly syncs between your phone, tablet, and computer, so you can access all your tasks from anywhere.
