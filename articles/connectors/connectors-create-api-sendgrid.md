# Get started with the SendGrid connector
SendGrid Connection Provider lets you send email and manage recipient lists.

You can get started by creating a Logic app now, see [Create a logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).

## Create a connection to SendGrid
To create Logic apps with SendGrid, you must first create a **connection** then provide the details for the following properties: 

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ApiKey |Yes |Provide Your SendGrid Api Key |

> [!INCLUDE [Steps to create a connection to SendGrid](../../includes/connectors-create-api-sendgrid.md)]
> 


After you create the connection, you can use it to execute the actions and listen for the triggers.

## Connector-specific details

View any triggers and actions defined in the swagger, and also see any limits in the [connector details](/connectors/sendgrid/).
