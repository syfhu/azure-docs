# Get started with the webhook connector

With the webhook action and trigger, you can start, pause, and resume flows to perform these tasks:

* Trigger from an [Azure Event Hub](https://github.com/logicappsio/EventHubAPI) when an item is received
* Wait for an approval before continuing a workflow

Learn more about [how to create custom APIs that support a webhook](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-api-app.md).

## Use the webhook trigger

A [*trigger*](connectors-overview.md) is an event that starts a logic app workflow. 
A webhook trigger is event-based and doesn't rely on polling for new items. 
Like the [request trigger](connectors-native-reqres.md), 
the logic app fires the instant that an event happens. 
The webhook trigger registers a *callback URL* to a service and uses that URL to fire the logic app as needed.

Here's an example that shows how to set up an HTTP trigger in the Logic App Designer. 
The steps assume that you have already deployed or are accessing an API that follows 
the [webhook subscribe and unsubscribe pattern in logic apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-api-app.md#webhook-triggers). 
The subscribe call is made whenever a logic app is saved with a new webhook, 
or switched from disabled to enabled. The unsubscribe call is made when 
a logic app webhook trigger is removed and saved, or switched from enabled to disabled.

**To add the webhook trigger**

1. Add the **HTTP Webhook** trigger as the first step in a logic app.
2. Fill in the parameters for the webhook subscribe and unsubscribe calls.

   This step follows the same pattern as the [HTTP action](connectors-native-http.md) format.

3. Add at least one action.
4. Click **Save** to publish the logic app. 
This step calls the subscribe endpoint with the callback URL needed to trigger this logic app.
5. Whenever the service makes an `HTTP POST` to the callback URL, 
the logic app fires, and includes any data passed into the request.

## Use the webhook action

An [*action*](connectors-overview.md) is an operation carried out by the workflow defined in a logic app. 
A webhook action registers a *callback URL* with a service and waits until the URL is called before resuming. 
The ["Send Approval Email"](connectors-create-api-office365-outlook.md) 
is an example of a connector that follows this pattern. 
You can extend this pattern into any service through the webhook action. 

Here's an example that shows how to set up a webhook action in the Logic App Designer. 
These steps assume that you have already deployed or are accessing an API that follows the 
[webhook subscribe and unsubscribe pattern used in logic apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-api-app.md#webhook-actions). 
The subscribe call is made when a logic app executes the webhook action. 
The unsubscribe call is made when a run is canceled while waiting for a response, 
or before the logic app times out.

**To add a webhook action**

1. Choose **New Step** > **Add an action**.

2. In the search box, type "webhook" to find the **HTTP Webhook** action.

    ![Select query action](./media/connectors-native-webhook/using-action-1.png)

3. Fill in the parameters for the webhook subscribe and unsubscribe calls

   This step follows the same pattern as the [HTTP action](connectors-native-http.md) format.

     ![Complete query action](./media/connectors-native-webhook/using-action-2.png)
   
   At runtime, the logic app calls the subscribe endpoint after reaching that step.

4. Click **Save** to publish the logic app.
