# Get started with the Yammer connector
Connect to Yammer to access conversations in your enterprise network. With Yammer, you can:

* Build your business flow based on the data you get from Yammer. 
* Use triggers for when there is a new message in a group, or a feed your following.
* Use actions to post a message, get all messages, and more. These actions get a response, and then make the output available for other actions. For example, when a new message appears, you can send an email using Office 365.

Get started by creating a logic app now; see [Create a logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).
