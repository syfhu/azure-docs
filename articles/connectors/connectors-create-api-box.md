# Get started with the Box connector
Connect to Box and create files, delete files, and more. With Box, you can:

* Build your business flow based on the data you get from Box. 
* Use triggers when a file is created or updated.
* Use actions that copy a file, delete a file, and more. These actions get a response, and then make the output available for other actions. For example, when a file is changed on Box, you can take that file and email it using Office 365.

You can get started by creating a logic app now, see [Create a logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).

## Connector-specific details

View any triggers and actions defined in the swagger, and also see any limits in the [connector details](/connectors/box/).
