# Get started with the SharePoint connector
The SharePoint Connector provides a way to work with Lists on SharePoint.

Get started by creating a logic app; see [Create a logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).

## Create a connection to SharePoint
To use the SharePoint Connector, you first create a **connection** then provide the details for these properties: 

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Token |Yes |Provide SharePoint Credentials |

To connect to **SharePoint**, enter your identity (username and password, smart card credentials, and so on). Once you've authenticated, you can proceed to use the SharePoint connector in your logic app. 

While on the designer of your logic app, use the following steps to sign in, and create the **connection** for use in your logic app:

1. Enter SharePoint in the search box and wait for the search to return all entries with SharePoint in the name:   
   ![Configure SharePoint][1]  
2. Select **SharePoint - When a file is created**   
3. Select **Sign in to SharePoint**:   
   ![Configure SharePoint][2]    
4. Provide your SharePoint credentials to sign in to authenticate with SharePoint   
   ![Configure SharePoint][3]     
5. After authentication completes, you're redirected to your logic app to complete it by configuring SharePoint's **When a file is created** dialog.          
   ![Configure SharePoint][4]  
6. You can then add other triggers and actions that you need to complete your logic app.   
7. Save your work by selecting **Save** on the menu (toward the top).
