# Get started with the Twilio connector
Connect to Twilio to send and receive global SMS, MMS, and IP messages. With Twilio, you can:

* Build your business flow based on the data you get from Twilio. 
* Use actions that get a message, list messages, and more. These actions get a response, and then make the output available for other actions. For example, when  you get a new Twilio message, you can take this message and use it a Service Bus workflow. 

Get started by creating a logic app; see [Create a logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).

## Create a connection to Twilio
When you add this Connector to your logic apps, enter the following Twilio values:

| Property | Required | Description |

If you don't have a Twilio access token, see [User Identity & Access Tokens](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/chat/guides/identity).
