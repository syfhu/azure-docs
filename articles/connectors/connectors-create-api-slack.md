# Get started with the Slack connector
Slack is a team communication tool, that brings together all of your team communications in one place, instantly searchable and available wherever you go. 

Get started by creating a logic app now; see [Create a logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).

## Create a connection to Slack
To use the Slack connector, you first create a **connection** then provide the details for these properties: 

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Token |Yes |Provide Slack Credentials |

Sign in to Slack using the following steps, and complete the configuration of the Slack **connection** in your logic app:

1. Select **Recurrence**
2. Select a **Frequency** and enter an **Interval**
3. Select **Add an action**  
   ![Configure Slack][1]  
4. Enter Slack in the search box and wait for the search to return all entries with Slack in the name
5. Select **Slack - Post message**
6. Select **Sign in to Slack**:  
   ![Configure Slack][2]
7. Provide your Slack credentials to sign in to authorize the  application    
   ![Configure Slack][3]  
8. You'll be redirected to your organization's login page. **Authorize** Slack to interact with your logic app:      
   ![Configure Slack][5] 
9. After authorization completes, you're redirected to your logic app to complete it by configuring the **Slack - Get all messages** section. Add other triggers and actions that you need.  
   ![Configure Slack][6]
10. Save your work by selecting **Save** on the menu (toward the top).
