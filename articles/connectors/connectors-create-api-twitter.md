# Get started with the Twitter connector
With the Twitter connector you can:

* Post tweets and get tweets
* Access timelines, friends, and followers
* Perform any of the other actions and triggers described in this article

To use [any connector](apis-list.md), you first need to create a logic app. You can get started by [creating a logic app now](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).  

## Connect to Twitter
Before your logic app can access any service, you first need to create a *connection* to the service. A [connection](connectors-overview.md) provides connectivity between a logic app and another service.  

### Create a connection to Twitter
> [!INCLUDE [Steps to create a connection to Twitter](../../includes/connectors-create-api-twitter.md)]
> 
> 

## Use a Twitter trigger
A trigger is an event that can be used to start the workflow defined in a logic app. [Learn more about triggers](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md#logic-app-concepts).

In this example, you use the **When a new tweet is posted**  trigger to search for #Seattle. And if #Seattle is found, update a file in Dropbox with the text from the tweet. In an enterprise example, you could search for the name of your company and update a SQL database with the text from the tweet.

1. Enter *twitter* in the search box on the logic apps designer then select the **Twitter - When a new tweet is posted**  trigger   
   ![Twitter trigger image 1](./media/connectors-create-api-twitter/trigger-1.png)  
2. Enter *#Seattle* in the **Search Text** control  
   ![Twitter trigger image 2](./media/connectors-create-api-twitter/trigger-2.png) 

At this point, your logic app has been configured with a trigger that will begin a run of the other triggers and actions in the workflow. 

> [!NOTE]
> For a logic app to be functional, it must contain at least one trigger and one action. Use the steps in the next section to add an action.

## Add a condition
We are only interested in tweets from users with more than 50 users. So, a condition that confirms the number of followers is added to the logic app first.  

1. Select **+ New step** to add the action you would like to take when #Seattle is found in a new tweet  
   ![Twitter action image 1](../../includes/media/connectors-create-api-twitter/action-1.png)  
2. Select the **Add a condition** link.  
   ![Twitter condition image 1](../../includes/media/connectors-create-api-twitter/condition-1.png)   
   This opens the **Condition** control where you can check conditions such as *is equal to*, *is less than*, *is greater than*, *contains*, etc.  
   ![Twitter condition image 2](../../includes/media/connectors-create-api-twitter/condition-2.png)   
3. Select the **Choose a value** control. In this control, you can select one or more of the properties from any previous actions or triggers. The condition of this property value is evaluated to true or false.
   ![Twitter condition image 3](../../includes/media/connectors-create-api-twitter/condition-3.png)   
4. Select the **...** to expand the list of properties so you can see all the properties that are available.        
   ![Twitter condition image 4](../../includes/media/connectors-create-api-twitter/condition-4.png)   
5. Select the **Followers count** property.    
   ![Twitter condition image 5](../../includes/media/connectors-create-api-twitter/condition-5.png)   
6. Notice the Followers count property is now in the value control.    
   ![Twitter condition image 6](../../includes/media/connectors-create-api-twitter/condition-6.png)   
7. Select **is greater than** from the operators list.    
   ![Twitter condition image 7](../../includes/media/connectors-create-api-twitter/condition-7.png)   
8. Enter 50 as the operand for the *is greater than* operator.  
   The condition is now added. Save your work using the **Save** link on the menu.

## Use a Twitter action
An action is an operation carried out by the workflow defined in a logic app. [Learn more about actions](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md#logic-app-concepts).  

Now that there's a trigger, add an action that posts a new tweet with the contents of the tweets found by the trigger. For this walk-through, only tweets from users with more than 50 followers are posted.  

In the next step, add a Twitter action that posts a tweet using some of the properties of each tweet that is posted by a user with more than 50 followers.  

1. Select **Add an action**. This step opens the search control where you can search for other actions and triggers.  
   ![Twitter condition image 9](../../includes/media/connectors-create-api-twitter/condition-9.png)   
2. Enter *twitter* into the search box then select the **Twitter - Post a tweet** action. This step opens the **Post a tweet** control where you enter all details for the tweet being posted.      
   ![Twitter action image 1-5](../../includes/media/connectors-create-api-twitter/action-1-5.png)   
3. Select the **Tweet text** control. All outputs from previous actions and triggers in the logic app are now visible. You can select any of these outputs, and use them as part of the tweet text of the new tweet.     
   ![Twitter action image 2](../../includes/media/connectors-create-api-twitter/action-2.png)   
4. Select **User name**   
5. Immediately after User name, enter *says:* in the tweet text control.
6. Select *Tweet text*.       
   ![Twitter action image 3](../../includes/media/connectors-create-api-twitter/action-3.png)   
7. To activate your workflow, save your work, and send a tweet with the #Seattle hashtag.
