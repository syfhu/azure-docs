# How to grant permissions to a custom-developed application

If you want to grant consent preemptively on your app or are running into an error that you have not consented to an app, try these steps below.

## How to perform Admin Consent for your application

This has the effect of granting consent to the application for all users in your organization.

1. Navigate to the **App Registrations** blade as a **global administrator**, then select the app.

2. Select **Required Permissions**, and finally hit the **Grant Permissions** button at the top of the blade.

Alternatively, you can construct a request to *login.microsoftonline.com* with your app configs and append on *&prompt=admin\_consent*. After signing in with admin credentials, the app has been granted consent for all users.

## How to force User Consent for your application

* Append onto auth requests *&prompt=consent* which require end users to consent each time they authenticate.
