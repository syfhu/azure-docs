# How do information workers add B2B collaboration users to Azure Active Directory?

Information workers can use the [Application Access Panel](http://myapps.microsoft.com) to add B2B collaboration users to groups and applications that they administer.

After a guest user is added to the directory, the information worker can either send the guest user a direct link to a shared app, or the guest user can click the redemption URL in the invitation email. For more information about the redemption process, see [B2B collaboration invitation redemption](redemption-experience.md).

## Information workers adding B2B collaboration users to an application
Assign B2B collaboration users to an app as an information worker in a partner organization, as shown in the following video:

## Information workers adding B2B collaboration users to a group

Information workers can similarly add B2B collaboration users to an assigned group that is enabled for self-service group management.
> [!NOTE]
> You cannot add B2B collaboration users to a dynamic group or to a group that is synced with on-premises Active Directory.
