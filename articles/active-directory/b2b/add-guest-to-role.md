# Grant permissions to users from partner organizations in your Azure Active Directory tenant

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2B collaboration users are added as guest users to the directory, and guest permissions in the directory are restricted by default. Your business may need some guest users to fill higher-privilege roles in your organization. To support defining higher-privilege roles, guest users can be added to any roles you desire, based on your organization's needs.
