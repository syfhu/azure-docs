# Configure named locations in Azure Active Directory

With named locations, you can label trusted IP address ranges in your organization. Azure Active Directory uses  named locations in the context of:

- The detection of [risk events](active-directory-reporting-risk-events.md) to reduce the number of reported false positives.  

- [Location-based conditional access](active-directory-conditional-access-locations.md).


This article explains, how you can configure named locations in your environment.


## Entry points

You can access the named location configuration page in the **Security** section of the Azure Active Directory page by clicking:

![Entry points](./media/active-directory-named-locations/34.png)

- **Conditional access:**

    - In the **Manage** section, click **Named locations**.

- **Risky sign-ins:**

    - In the toolbar on the top, click **Add known IP address ranges**.

    a. In the **Name** box, type a name for your named location.

    c. Click **Create**.
