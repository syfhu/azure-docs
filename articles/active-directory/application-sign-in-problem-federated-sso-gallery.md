# Problems signing in to a gallery application configured for federated single sign-on

To troubleshoot your problem, you need to verify the application configuration in Azure AD as follow:

-   You have followed all the configuration steps for the Azure AD gallery application.

-   The Identifier and Reply URL configured in AAD match they expected values in the application

-   You have assigned users to the application

## Application not found in directory

*Error AADSTS70001: Application with Identifier ‘https://contoso.com’ was not found in the directory*.

**Possible cause**

The Issuer attribute sends from the application to Azure AD in the SAML request doesn’t match the Identifier value configured in the application Azure AD.

**Resolution**

Ensure that the Issuer attribute in the SAML request it’s matching the Identifier value configured in Azure AD:

1.  Open the [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in as a **Global Administrator** or **Co-admin.**

2.  Open the **Azure Active Directory Extension** by clicking **All services** at the top of the main left-hand navigation menu.

3.  Type in **“Azure Active Directory**” in the filter search box and select the **Azure Active Directory** item.

4.  click **Enterprise Applications** from the Azure Active Directory left-hand navigation menu.

5.  click **All Applications** to view a list of all your applications.

  * If you do not see the application you want show up here, use the **Filter** control at the top of the **All Applications List** and set the **Show** option to **All Applications.**

6.  Select the application you want to configure single sign-on

7.  Once the application loads, click the **Single sign-on** from the application’s left-hand navigation menu.

8.  Go to **Domain and URLs** section. Verify that the value in the Identifier textbox is matching the value for the identifier value displayed in the error.

After you have updated the Identifier value in Azure AD and it’s matching the value sends by the application in the SAML request, you should be able to sign in to the application.

## The reply address does not match the reply addresses configured for the application.

*Error AADSTS50011: The reply address ‘https://contoso.com’ does not match the reply addresses configured for the application*

**Possible cause**

The AssertionConsumerServiceURL value in the SAML request doesn't match the Reply URL value or pattern configured in Azure AD. The AssertionConsumerServiceURL value in the SAML request is the URL you see in the error.

**Resolution**

Ensure that the AssertionConsumerServiceURL value in the SAML request it's matching the Reply URL value configured in Azure AD.

1.  Open the [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in as a **Global Administrator** or **Co-admin.**

2.  Open the **Azure Active Directory Extension** by clicking **All services** at the top of the main left-hand navigation menu.

3.  Type in **“Azure Active Directory**” in the filter search box and select the **Azure Active Directory** item.

4.  click **Enterprise Applications** from the Azure Active Directory left-hand navigation menu.

## Not a valid SAML Request

*Error AADSTS75005: The request is not a valid Saml2 protocol message.*

**Possible cause**

Azure AD doesn’t support the SAML Request sent by the application for Single Sign-on. Some common issues are:

-   Missing required fields in the SAML request

-   SAML request encoded method

**Resolution**

1.  Capture SAML request. follow the tutorial [How to debug SAML-based single sign-on to applications in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-saml-debugging) to learn how to capture the SAML request.

2.  Contact the application vendor and share:

   -   SAML request

   -   [Azure AD Single Sign-on SAML protocol requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-single-sign-on-protocol-reference)

They should validate they support the Azure AD SAML implementation for Single Sign-on.
