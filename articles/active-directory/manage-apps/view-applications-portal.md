# View all the enterprise apps that I can manage in Azure Active Directory
You can manage your enterprise applications in the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You can view the apps you can manage, assign users or groups to an app, maintain properties for the app such as the application name/logo, and even disable an application so that no users can sign in to it. To provide feedback or make suggestions about improving the experience, click [here.](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR4T3-G0YQw9Hl78oLEwFNj1UQVhGMDZFNEhFTDZHUDNBSUk3UVFPODVBWC4u) 

## How do I view all my apps?
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that's a global admin for the directory.
2. Select **All services**, enter **Azure Active Directory** in the text box, and then select **Enter**.
3. On the **Azure Active Directory -** ***directoryname*** pane (that is, the Azure AD pane for the directory you are managing), select **Enterprise applications**.

4. On the **Enterprise applications** pane, select **All applications**. From this pane you can select apps to manage, change the displayed columns, or filter the list to find that app you want (for example, to view only disabled apps).
