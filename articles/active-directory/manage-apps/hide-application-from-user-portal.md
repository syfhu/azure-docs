# Hide an application from user's experience in Azure Active Directory

If you have an application that you do not want to show on users’ access panels or Office 365 launchers, there are options to hide this app tile.  The following two options are available for hiding applications from user's app launchers.

- Hide a third-party application from users access panels and Office 365 app launchers
- Hide all Office 365 applications from users access panels

By hiding the app users still have permissions to the app but will not see them appear on their app launchers. You must have the appropriate permissions to manage the enterprise app, and you must be a global admin for the directory.


## Hiding an application from user's end user experiences
You can use the steps below, depending on your situation, to hide applications from the access panel.

### How do I hide a third-party app from user’s access panel and O365 app launchers?
