# Review your access

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) simplifies how enterprises manage access to applications and members of groups in Azure AD and other Microsoft Online Services with a feature called access reviews. Perhaps you received an email from Microsoft that asks you to review access for members of a group or users with access to an application. 

## Open an access review

To see the pending access reviews, select the link in the email. If you don't have the email, you can locate the access reviews by following these steps:

1. Sign in on the [Azure AD access panel](https://myapps.microsoft.com).

2. Select the user symbol in the upper-right corner of the page, which displays your name and default organization. If more than one organization is listed, select the organization that requested an access review.

3. If a tile labeled **Access reviews** is on the right side of the page, select it. If the tile isn't visible, there are no access reviews to perform for that organization and no action is needed at this time.

## Fill out an access review

When you select an access review from the list, you can see your access. Select the row, and choose whether to approve or deny your need for continued access.

The reviewer might require that you supply a justification for approving continued access.

## Next steps

Denied access isn't removed immediately. If you want to change your answer and approve, reset the response and select a new response. You can do this step until the access review is finished.
