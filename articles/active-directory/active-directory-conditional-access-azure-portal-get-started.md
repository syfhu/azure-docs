# Get started with conditional access in Azure Active Directory

Conditional access is a capability of Azure Active Directory that enables you to define conditions under which authorized users can access your apps. 

This topic provides you with instructions for testing a conditional access based on a location condition in your environment.  


## Scenario description

One common requirement in many organizations is to only require multi-factor authentication for access to apps that is not performed from the corporate intranet. With Azure Active Directory, you can easily accomplish this goal by configuring a location-based conditional access policy. This topic provides you with detailed instructions for configuring a related policy. The policy leverages [Trusted IPs](authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings.md#trusted-ips) to distinguish between access attempts made from the corporate's intranet and all other locations.


## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this topic assumes that you are familiar with the concepts outlined in [Azure Active Directory conditional access](active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal.md).

To test this scenario, you need to:

- Create a test user 

- Assign an Azure AD Premium license to the test user

- Configure a managed app and assign your test user to it

- Configure trusted IPs

If you need more details about Trusted IPs, see [Trusted IPs](authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings.md#trusted-ips).


## Policy configuration steps

**To configure your conditional access policy, do:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the left navbar, click **Azure Active Directory**.

11. On the **Locations** blade, perform the following steps:

    ![Conditional access](./media/active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal-get-started/11.png)

    a. Under **Configure**, click **Yes**.

    b. Under **Include**, click **All locations**.

    c. Click **Exclude**, and then click **All trusted IPs**.

    d. Click **Done**.

12. On the **Conditions** blade, click **Done**.

13. On the **New** blade, to open the **Grant** blade, in the **Controls** section, click **Grant**.

    ![Conditional access](./media/active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal-get-started/13.png)

14. On the **Grant** blade, perform the following steps:

    ![Conditional access](./media/active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal-get-started/14.png)

    a. Select **Require multi-factor authentication**.

    b. Click **Select**.

15. On the **New** blade, under **Enable policy**, click **On**.

    ![Conditional access](./media/active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal-get-started/15.png)

16. On the **New** blade, click **Create**.


## Testing the policy

To test your policy, you should access your app from a device that: 

1. Has an IP address that is within your configured Trusted IPs 

1. Has an IP address that is not within your configured Trusted IPs

Multi-factor authentication should only be required during a connection attempt that was made from a device that is not within your configured Trusted IPs.
