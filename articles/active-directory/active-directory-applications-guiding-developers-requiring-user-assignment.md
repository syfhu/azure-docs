# Azure AD and applications: Require user assignment
## Requiring User Assignment
1. Log in to the Azure portal with an administrator account.
2. Click on the **All services** item in the main menu.
3. Choose the directory you are using for the application.
4. Click on the **Enterprise applications** tab.
5. Select the application from the list of applications associated with this directory.
6. Click the **Properties** tab.
7. Change the **User assignment required?** toggle to Yes.
8. Click the **Save** button at the top of the screen.

You will now have to assign users and/or groups to the application. See [Assigning users to an application](active-directory-applications-guiding-developers-assigning-users.md) and [Assigning groups to an application](active-directory-applications-guiding-developers-assigning-groups.md).
