# Azure Active Directory proof of concept playbook: Building blocks

## Catalog of roles

| Role | Description | Proof of concept (PoC) responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Identity Architecture / development team** | This team is usually the one that designs the solution, implements prototypes, drives approvals, and finally hands off to operations | They provide the environments and are the ones evaluating the different scenarios from the manageability perspective |
| **On-Premises Identity Operations team** | Manages the different identity sources on-premises: Active Directory Forests, LDAP directories, HR systems, and Federation Identity Providers. | Provide access to on-premises resources needed for the PoC scenarios.<br/>They should be involved as little as possible|
| **Application Technical Owners** | Technical owners of the different cloud apps and services that will integrate with Azure AD | Provide details on SaaS applications (potentially instances for testing) |
| **Azure AD Global Admin** | Manages the Azure AD configuration | Provide credentials to configure the synchronization service. Usually the same team as Identity Architecture during PoC but separate during the operations phase|
| **Database team** | Owners of the Database infrastructure | Provide access to SQL environment (ADFS or Azure AD Connect) for specific scenario preparations.<br/>They should be involved as little as possible |
| **Network team** | Owners of the Network infrastructure | Provide required access at the network level for the synchronization servers to properly access the data sources and cloud services (firewall rules, ports opened, IPSec rules etc.) |
| **Security team** | Defines the security strategy, analyzes security reports from various sources, and follows through on findings. | Provide target security evaluation scenarios |

## Common Prerequisites for all building blocks

Following are some pre-requisites needed for any POC with Azure AD Premium.

| Pre-requisite | Resources |
| --- | --- |
| Azure AD tenant defined with a valid Azure subscription | [How to get an Azure Active Directory tenant](active-directory-howto-tenant.md)<br/>**Note:** If you already have an environment with Azure AD Premium licenses, you can get a zero cap subscription by navigating to https://aka.ms/accessaad <br/>Learn more at: https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2016/02/26/azure-ad-mailbag-azure-subscriptions-and-azure-ad-2/ and https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn832618.aspx |
| Domains defined and verified | [Add a custom domain name to Azure Active Directory](active-directory-domains-add-azure-portal.md)<br/>**Note:** Some workloads such as Power BI could have provisioned an azure AD tenant under the covers. To check if a given domain is associated to a tenant, navigate to https://login.microsoftonline.com/{domain}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration. If you get a successful response, then the domain is already assigned to a tenant and take over might be needed. If so, contact Microsoft for further guidance. Learn more about the takeover options at: [What is Self-Service Signup for Azure?](users-groups-roles/directory-self-service-signup.md) |
| Azure AD Premium or EMS trial Enabled | [Azure Active Directory Premium free for one month](https://azure.microsoft.com/trial/get-started-active-directory/) |
| You have assigned Azure AD Premium or EMS licenses to PoC users | [License yourself and your users in Azure Active Directory](active-directory-licensing-get-started-azure-portal.md) |
| Azure AD Global Admin credentials | [Assigning administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md) |
| Optional but strongly recommended: Parallel lab environment as a fallback | [Prerequisites for Azure AD Connect](./connect/active-directory-aadconnect-prerequisites.md) |

## Directory Synchronization - Password Hash Sync (PHS) - New Installation

Approximate time to Complete: one hour for less than 1,000 PoC users

### Pre-requisites

| Pre-requisite | Resources |
| --- | --- |
| Server to Run Azure AD Connect | [Prerequisites for Azure AD Connect](./connect/active-directory-aadconnect-prerequisites.md) |
| Target POC users, in the same domain and part of a security group, and OU | [Custom installation of Azure AD Connect](./connect/active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom.md#domain-and-ou-filtering) |
| Azure AD Connect Features needed for the POC are identified | [Connect Active Directory with Azure Active Directory - Configure sync features](./connect/active-directory-aadconnect.md#configure-sync-features) |
| You have needed credentials for on-premises and cloud environments  | [Azure AD Connect: Accounts and permissions](./connect/active-directory-aadconnect-accounts-permissions.md) |

### Steps

| Step | Resources |
| --- | --- |
| Download the latest version of Azure AD Connect | [Download Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47594) |
| Install Azure AD Connect with the simplest path: Express <br/>1. Filter to the target OU to minimize the Sync Cycle time<br/>2. Choose target set of users in the on-premises group.<br/>3. Deploy the features needed by the other POC Themes | [Azure AD Connect: Custom installation: Domain and OU filtering](./connect/active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom.md#domain-and-ou-filtering) <br/>[Azure AD Connect: Custom installation: Group based filtering](./connect/active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom.md#sync-filtering-based-on-groups)<br/>[Azure AD Connect: Integrating your on-premises identities with Azure Active Directory: Configure Sync Features](./connect/active-directory-aadconnect.md#configure-sync-features) |
| Open the Azure AD Connect UI and see the running profiles completed (Import, sync, and export) | [Azure AD Connect sync: Scheduler](./connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-feature-scheduler.md) |
| Open the [Azure AD management portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/UserManagementMenuBlade/), go to the "All Users" blade, add "Source of authority" column and see that the users appear, marked properly as coming from "Windows Server AD" | [Azure AD management portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview) |

### Considerations

1. Look at  the security considerations of password hash sync [here](./connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-implement-password-hash-synchronization.md).  If password hash sync for pilot production users is definitively not an option, then consider the following alternatives:
   * Create test users in the production domain. Make sure you don't synchronize any other account
   * Move to an UAT environment
2.	If you want to pursue federation, it is worthwhile to understand the costs associated a federated solution with on-premises Identity Provider beyond the POC and measure that against the benefits you are looking for:
    * It is in the critical path so you have to design for high availability
    * It is an on-premises service you need to capacity plan
    * It is an on-premises service you need to monitor/maintain/patch

| Step | Resources |
| --- | --- |
| Remove the user from the group the app is assigned to | [Manage group membership for users in your Azure Active Directory tenant](fundamentals/active-directory-groups-members-azure-portal.md) |
| Wait for a few minutes for de-provisioning | [Automated SaaS App User Provisioning in Azure AD: How does automated provisioning work?](active-directory-saas-app-provisioning.md#how-does-automatic-provisioning-work) |
| On a separate browser session, log in as the information worker to my apps portal and confirm that tile is missing | http://myapps.microsoft.com |


### Considerations

Extrapolate the PoC scenario to leavers and/or leave of absence scenarios. If the user gets disabled in on-premises AD or removed, there is no longer a way to log in to the SaaS application.

## Self Service Access to Application Management

Approximate time to Complete: 10 minutes

### Pre-requisites

| Pre-requisite | Resources |
| --- | --- |
| Identify POC users that will request access to the applications, as part of the security group | Building block: [SaaS Federated SSO Configuration](#saas-federated-sso-configuration) |
| Target Application deployed | Building block: [SaaS Federated SSO Configuration](#saas-federated-sso-configuration) |

### Steps

| Step | Resources |
| --- | --- |
| Go to Enterprise Applications blade in Azure AD Management Portal | [Azure AD Management Portal: Enterprise Applications](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/AllApps/menuId/) |
| Configure Application from Pre-requisites with self service | [What's new in Enterprise Application management in Azure Active Directory: Configure self-service application access](active-directory-enterprise-apps-whats-new-azure-portal.md#configure-self-service-application-access) |
| Log in as the information worker to my apps portal | http://myapps.microsoft.com |
| Notice "+Add app" button on op of the page. Use it to get access to the app |  |

### Considerations

The applications chosen might have provisioning requirements, so going immediately to the app might cause some errors. If the application chosen supports provisioning with azure ad and it is configured, you might use this as an opportunity to show the whole flow working end to end. See the building block for [SaaS Federated SSO Configuration](#saas-federated-sso-configuration) for further recommendations

## Self Service Password Reset

Approximate time to Complete: 15 minutes

### Pre-requisites

| Pre-requisite | Resources |
| --- | --- |
| Enable self-service password management in your tenant. | [Azure Active Directory password reset for IT administrators](active-directory-passwords-update-your-own-password.md) |
| Enable password write-back to manage passwords from on-premises. Note this requires specific Azure AD Connect versions | [Password Writeback prerequisites](authentication/howto-sspr-writeback.md) |
| Identify the PoC users that will use this functionality, and make sure they are members of a security group. The users must be non-admins to fully showcase the capability | [Customize: Azure AD Password Management: Restrict Access to password reset](authentication/howto-sspr-writeback.md) |


### Steps

| Step | Resources |
| --- | --- |
| Navigate to Azure AD Management Portal: Password Reset | [Azure AD Management Portal: Password Reset](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/PasswordReset) |
| Determine the password reset policy. For POC purposes, you can use phone call and Q & A. It is recommended to enable registration to be required on log in to access panel |  |
| Log out and log in as an information worker |  |
| Supply the Self-Service Password Reset data as configured per step 2 | https://aka.ms/ssprsetup |
| Close the browser |  |
| Start over the login process as the information worker you used in step 4 |  |
| Reset the password | [Update your own password: Reset my password](active-directory-passwords-update-your-own-password.md) |
| Try logging in with your new password to Azure AD as well as to on-premises resources |  |

### Considerations

1. If upgrading the Azure AD Connect is going to cause friction, then consider using it against cloud accounts or make it a demo against a separate environment
2. The administrators have a different policy and using the admin account to reset the password might taint the PoC and cause confusion. Make sure you use a regular user account to test the reset operations


## Azure Multi-Factor Authentication with Phone Calls

Approximate time to Complete: 10 minutes

### Pre-requisites

| Pre-requisite | Resources |
| --- | --- |
| Identify POC users that will use MFA  |  |
| Phone with good reception for MFA challenge  | [What is Azure Multi-Factor Authentication?](authentication/multi-factor-authentication.md) |

### Steps

| Step | Resources |
| --- | --- |
| Navigate to "Users and groups" blade in Azure AD Management Portal | [Azure AD Management Portal: Users and groups](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/UserManagementMenuBlade/Overview/menuId/) |
| Choose "All users" blade |  |
| In the top bar choose "Multi-Factor Authentication" button | Direct URL for Azure MFA portal: https://aka.ms/mfaportal |
| In the "User" settings select the PoC users and enable them for MFA | [User States in Azure Multi-Factor Authentication](authentication/howto-mfa-userstates.md) |
| Login as the PoC user, and walk through the proof-up process  |  |

### Considerations

1. The PoC steps in this building block explicitly setting MFA for a user on all logins. There are other tools such as Conditional Access, and Identity Protection that engage MFA on more targeted scenarios. This will be something to consider when moving from POC to production.
2. The PoC steps in this building block are explicitly using Phone Calls as the MFA method for expedience. As you transition from POC to production, we recommend using applications such as the [Microsoft Authenticator](authentication/end-user/current/microsoft-authenticator-app-how-to.md) as your second factor whenever possible.

## MFA Conditional Access for SaaS applications

Approximate time to Complete: 10 minutes

### Pre-requisites

| Pre-requisite | Resources |
| --- | --- |
| Identify PoC users to target the policy. These users should be in a security group to scope the conditional access policy | [SaaS Federated SSO Configuration](#saas-federated-sso-configuration) |
| SaaS application has been already configured |  |
| PoC users are already assigned to the application |  |
| Credentials to the POC user are available |  |
| POC user is registered for MFA. Using a phone with Good reception | https://aka.ms/ssprsetup |
| Device in the internal network. IP Address configured in the internal address range | Find your ip address: https://www.bing.com/search?q=what%27s+my+ip |
| Device in the external network (can be a phone using the carrier's mobile network) |  |

### Steps

| Step | Resources |
| --- | --- |
| Go to Azure AD Management Portal: Conditional Access blade | [Azure AD Management Portal: Conditional Access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ConditionalAccessBlade/Policies) |
| Create Conditional Access policy:<br/>- Target PoC Users under "Users and groups"<br/>- Target PoC Application under "Cloud apps"<br/>- Target all locations except trusted ones under "Conditions" -> "Locations" **Note:** trusted IPs are configured in [MFA Portal](https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/UserManagement/MfaSettings.aspx)<br/>- Require multi-factor authentication under "Grant" | [Get started with conditional access in Azure Active Directory: Policy configuration steps](active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal-get-started.md#policy-configuration-steps) |
| Access application from inside corporate network | [Get started with conditional access in Azure Active Directory: Testing the policy](active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal-get-started.md#testing-the-policy) |
| Access application from public network | [Get started with conditional access in Azure Active Directory: Testing the policy](active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal-get-started.md#testing-the-policy) |

### Considerations

If you are using federation, you can use the on-premises Identity Provider (IdP) to communicate the inside/outside corporate network state with claims. You can use this technique without having to manage the list of IP addresses which might be complex to assess and manage in large organizations. In that setup, you need account for the "network roaming" scenario (a user logging from the internal network, and while logged in switches locations such as a coffee shop) and make sure you understand the implications.
