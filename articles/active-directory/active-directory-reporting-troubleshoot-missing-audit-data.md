# I can’t find some actions that I performed in the Azure Active Directory activity log


## Symptoms

I performed some actions in the Azure portal and expected to see the audit logs for those actions in the `Activity logs > Audit Logs` blade, but I can’t find them.

 ![Reporting](./media/active-directory-reporting-troubleshoot-missing-audit-data/01.png)
 

## Cause

Actions don’t appear immediately in the Activity Audit log. It can take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour to see the audit logs in the portal from the time the operation is performed.

## Resolution

Wait for 15 minutes to an hour and see if the actions appear in the log. If you still don’t see them, please raise a support ticket with us and we will look into it.


## Next steps
See the [Azure Active Directory reporting FAQ](active-directory-reporting-faq.md).
