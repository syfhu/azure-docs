# Monitor your on-premises identity infrastructure and synchronization services in the cloud
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Connect Health helps you monitor and gain insights into your on-premises identity infrastructure and the synchronization services. It enables you to maintain a reliable connection to Office 365 and Microsoft Online Services by providing monitoring capabilities for your key identity components such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) servers, Azure AD Connect servers (also known as Sync Engine), Active Directory domain controllers, etc. It also makes the key data points about these components easily accessible so that you can get usage and other important insights to make informed decisions.

The information is presented in the [Azure AD Connect Health portal](https://aka.ms/aadconnecthealth). In the Azure AD Connect Health portal, you can view alerts, performance monitoring, usage analytics, and other information. Azure AD Connect Health enables the single lens of health for your key identity components in one place.

As the features in Azure AD Connect Health increase, the portal provides a single dashboard through the lens of identity. You get an even more robust, healthy, and integrated environment for your users to increase their ability to get things done.
## Why use Azure AD Connect Health?
When you integrate your on-premises directories with Azure AD, your users are more productive because there's a common identity to access both cloud and on-premises resources. However, this integration creates the challenge of ensuring that this environment is healthy so that users can reliably access resources both on premises and in the cloud from any device. Azure AD Connect Health helps you monitor and gain insights into your on-premises identity infrastructure that is used to access Office 365 or other Azure AD applications. It is as simple as installing an agent on each of your on-premises identity servers.
