# I can’t find any data in the Azure Active Directory activity logs I downloaded


## Symptoms

I downloaded the activity logs (audit or sign-ins) and I don’t see all the records for the time I chose. Why?

## Cause

When you download activity logs in the Azure portal, we limit the scale to 5000 records, sorted by most recent first. 

## Resolution

You can leverage [Azure AD Reporting APIs](active-directory-reporting-api-getting-started.md) to fetch up to a million records at any given point. Our recommended approach is to run a script on a scheduled basis that calls the reporting APIs to fetch records in an incremental fashion over a period of time (for example, daily or weekly).

## Next steps
See the [Azure Active Directory reporting FAQ](active-directory-reporting-faq.md).
