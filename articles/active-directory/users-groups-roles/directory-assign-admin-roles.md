# Assigning administrator roles in Azure Active Directory

Using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can designate separate administrators to serve different functions. Administrators can be designated in the Azure AD portal to perform tasks such as adding or changing users, assigning administrative roles, resetting user passwords, managing user licenses, and managing domain names.

## Details about the global administrator role
The global administrator has access to all administrative features. By default, the person who signs up for an Azure subscription is assigned the global administrator role for the directory. Only global administrators can assign other administrator roles.

## Assign or remove administrator roles
