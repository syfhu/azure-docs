# View all members of an administrator role in Azure Active Directory

You can now see and manage all the members of the administrator roles in the Azure Active Directory portal. If you frequently manage role assignments, you will probably prefer this experience. And if you ever wondered “What the heck do these roles really do?”, you can see a detailed list of permissions for each of the Azure AD administrator roles.

It's easy to see your own permissions as well. Click **Your role** get quick access to your user page for a list of all your active assigned roles. Click the ellipsis on the right of each row to open the detailed description of the role.

Select the entire row to view the list of assigned members. You can select **Manage in PIM** for additional management capabilities. Privileged Role Administrators can change “Permanent” (always active in the role) assignments to “Eligible” (in the role only when elevated). If you don't have PIM, you can still select **Manage in PIM** to sign up for a trial. Privileged Identity Management requires an [Azure AD Premium P2 license plan](../privileged-identity-management/subscription-requirements.md).

If you are a Global Administrator or a Privileged Role Administrator, you can easily add or remove members, filter the list, or select a member to go to the user page to see their active assigned roles. 

## Role details in the portal

When you're viewing a role's members, select **Description** to see the complete list of permissions granted by the role assignment. The page includes links to relevant documentation to help guide you through managing directory roles.
