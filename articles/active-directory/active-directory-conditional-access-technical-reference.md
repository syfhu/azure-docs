# Azure Active Directory conditional access settings reference

You can use [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) conditional access](active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal.md) to control how authorized users can access your resources.   

This article provides you with support information for the following configuration options in a conditional access policy: 

- Cloud applications assignments

- Device platform condition 

- Client applications condition

- Approved client application requirement


If this is not the information you are looking for, please leave a comment at the end of this article.

## Cloud apps assignments

With conditional access policies, you control how your users access your [cloud apps](active-directory-conditional-access-conditions.md#cloud-apps). When you configure a conditional access policy, you need to select at least one cloud app.

### Microsoft cloud applications

You can assign a conditional access policy to the following cloud apps from Microsoft:

- Azure Information Protection - [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/information-protection/get-started/faqs#i-see-azure-information-protection-is-listed-as-an-available-cloud-app-for-conditional-accesshow-does-this-work)

- Azure RemoteApp

- Microsoft Dynamics 365

- Microsoft Office 365 Yammer

- Microsoft Office 365 Exchange Online

- Microsoft Office 365 SharePoint Online (includes OneDrive for Business and Project Online)

- Microsoft Power BI 

- Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services

- Microsoft Teams


### Other applications 

In addition to the Microsoft cloud apps, you can assign a conditional access policy to the following types of cloud apps:

- Azure AD-connected applications

- Pre-integrated federated software as a service (SaaS) application

- Applications that use password single sign-on (SSO)

- Line-of-business applications

- Applications that use Azure AD Application Proxy


## Device platform condition

In a conditional access policy, you can configure the device platform condition to tie the policy to the operating system on a client. Azure AD conditional access supports the following device platforms:

- Android

- iOS

- Windows Phone

- Windows

- macOS

## Client apps condition 

In your conditional access policy, you can configure the [client apps](active-directory-conditional-access-conditions.md#client-apps) condition to tie the policy to the client app that has initiated an access attempt. Set the client apps condition to grant or block access when an access attempt is made from the following types of client apps:

- Browser
- Mobile apps and desktop apps

![Control access for client apps](./media/active-directory-conditional-access-technical-reference/03.png)

### Supported browsers 

In your conditional access policy, you can select **Browsers** as client app.

![Control access for supported browsers](./media/active-directory-conditional-access-technical-reference/05.png)

This setting works with all browsers. However, to satisfy a device policy, like a compliant device requirement, the following operating systems and browsers are supported:


| OS                     | Browsers                            | Support     |
| :--                    | :--                                 | :-:         |
| Windows 10             | Internet Explorer, Edge, Chrome     | ![Check][1] |
| Windows 8 / 8.1        | Internet Explorer, Chrome           | ![Check][1] |
| Windows 7              | Internet Explorer, Chrome           | ![Check][1] |
| iOS                    | Safari, Intune Managed Browser      | ![Check][1] |
| Android                | Chrome, Intune Managed Browser      | ![Check][1] |

| Windows Server 2016    | Internet Explorer, Edge             | ![Check][1] |
| Windows Server 2016    | Chrome                              | Coming soon |
| Windows Server 2012 R2 | Internet Explorer, Chrome           | ![Check][1] |
| Windows Server 2008 R2 | Internet Explorer, Chrome           | ![Check][1] |
| macOS                  | Chrome, Safari                      | ![Check][1] |



#### Chrome support

For Chrome support in **Windows 10 Creators Update (version 1703)** or later, install [this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/windows-10-accounts/ppnbnpeolgkicgegkbkbjmhlideopiji).

To automatically deploy this extension to Chrome browsers, create the following registry key:

|    |    |
|--- | ---|
|Path | HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Google\Chrome\ExtensionInstallForcelist |
|Name | 1 |
|Type | REG_SZ (String) |
|Data | ppnbnpeolgkicgegkbkbjmhlideopiji;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx

For Chrome support in **Windows 8.1 and 7**, create the following registry key:

|    |    |
|--- | ---|
|Path | HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome\AutoSelectCertificateForUrls |
|Name | 1 |
|Type | REG_SZ (String) |
|Data | {"pattern":"https://device.login.microsoftonline.com","filter":{"ISSUER":{"CN":"MS-Organization-Access"}}}|

These browsers support device authentication, allowing the device to be identified and validated against a policy. The device check fails if the browser is running in private mode. 


### Supported mobile applications and desktop clients

In your conditional access policy, you can select **Mobile apps and desktop clients** as client app.


![Control access for supported mobile apps or desktop clients](./media/active-directory-conditional-access-technical-reference/06.png)
