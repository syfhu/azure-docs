# Set up Azure Active Directory registered Windows 10 devices

With device management in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can ensure that your users are accessing your resources from devices that meet your standards for security and compliance. For more information, see [Introduction to device management in Azure Active Directory](device-management-introduction.md).

If you want to enable the **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** scenario, you can accomplish this by configuring Azure AD registered devices. In Azure AD, you can configure Azure AD registered devices for Windows 10, iOS, Android, and macOS. This article provides you with the related steps for Windows 10 devices. 


## Before you begin

To register a Windows 10 device, the device registration service must be configured to enable you to register devices. Additionally, you must have fewer devices registered than the configured maximum. For more information, see [configure device settings](device-management-azure-portal.md#configure-device-settings).

## What you should know

When registering a device, you should keep the following in mind:

- Windows registers the device in the organizationâ€™s directory in Azure AD

- You might be required to go through multi-factor authentication challenge. This challenge is configurable by your IT administrator.

- Azure AD checks whether the device requires mobile device management enrollment and enrolls it if applicable.

- If you are a managed user, Windows takes you to the desktop through the automatic sign-in.

- If you are a federated user, you will be taken to a Windows sign-in screen to enter your credentials.


## Registering a device

This section provides you with the steps to register your Windows 10 device to your Azure AD. A successfully registered device shows up with a **Work or school account** entry.

## Verification

To verify whether a device is joined to an Azure AD, you can review the **Access work or school** dialog on your device.

Alternatively, you can review device settings on the Azure AD portal.
