# Create, list and delete a user assigned identity using Azure Resource Manager

[!INCLUDE[preview-notice](~/includes/active-directory-msi-preview-notice-ua.md)]

Managed Service Identity provides Azure services with a managed identity in Azure Active Directory. You can use this identity to authenticate to services that support Azure AD authentication, without needing credentials in your code. 

In this article, you create a user assigned managed identity using an Azure Resource Manager.

It is not possible to list and delete a user assigned identity using an Azure Resource Manager template.  See the following articles to create and list a user assigned identity:

- [List user assigned identity](how-to-manage-ua-identity-cli.md#list-user-assigned-identities)
- [Delete user assigned identity](how-to-manage-ua-identity-cli.md#delete-a-user-assigned-identity)
## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with Managed Service Identity, check out the [overview section](overview.md). **Be sure to review the [difference between a system assigned and user assigned identity](overview.md#how-does-it-work)**.
- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before continuing.

Whether you sign in to Azure locally or via the Azure portal, use an account that is associated with the Azure subscription that contains the VM. Also ensure that your account belongs to a role that gives you write permissions on the VM (for example, the role of “Virtual Machine Contributor”).

## Template creation and editing

As with the Azure portal and scripting, Azure Resource Manager templates provide the ability to deploy new or modified resources defined by an Azure resource group. Several options are available for template editing and deployment, both local and portal-based, including:

- Using a [custom template from the Azure Marketplace](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy-portal.md#deploy-resources-from-custom-template), which allows you to create a template from scratch, or base it on an existing common or [QuickStart template](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/templates/).
- Deriving from an existing resource group, by exporting a template from either [the original deployment](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-export-template.md#view-template-from-deployment-history), or from the [current state of the deployment](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-export-template.md#export-the-template-from-resource-group).
- Using a local [JSON editor (such as VS Code)](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-create-first-template.md), and then uploading and deploying by using PowerShell or CLI.
- Using the Visual Studio [Azure Resource Group project](../../azure-resource-manager/vs-azure-tools-resource-groups-deployment-projects-create-deploy.md) to both create and deploy a template. 

## Create a user assigned identity 

To create a user assigned identity, use the following template. Replace the `<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>` value with your own values:

[!INCLUDE[ua-character-limit](~/includes/managed-identity-ua-character-limits.md)]

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "resourceName": {
          "type": "string",
          "metadata": {
            "description": "<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>"
          }
        }
  },
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities",
      "name": "[parameters('<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>')]",
      "apiVersion": "2015-08-31-PREVIEW",
      "location": "[resourceGroup().location]"
    }
  ],
  "outputs": {
      "identityName": {
          "type": "string",
          "value": "[parameters('<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>')]"
      }
  }
}
```
