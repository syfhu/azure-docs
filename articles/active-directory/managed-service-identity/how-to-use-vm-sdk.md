# How to use an Azure VM Managed Service Identity (MSI) with Azure SDKs 

[!INCLUDE[preview-notice](../../../includes/active-directory-msi-preview-notice.md)]  
This article provides a list of SDK samples, which demonstrate use of their respective Azure SDK's support for MSI.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [msi-qs-configure-prereqs](../../../includes/active-directory-msi-qs-configure-prereqs.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - All sample code/script in this article assumes the client is running on an MSI-enabled Virtual Machine. Use the VM "Connect" feature in the Azure portal, to remotely connect to your VM. For details on enabling MSI on a VM, see [Configure a VM Managed Service Identity (MSI) using the Azure portal](qs-configure-portal-windows-vm.md), or one of the variant articles (using PowerShell, CLI, a template, or an Azure SDK).
