# Configure a VM Managed Service Identity (MSI) using an Azure SDK

[!INCLUDE[preview-notice](../../../includes/active-directory-msi-preview-notice.md)]

Managed Service Identity provides Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory (AD). You can use this identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, without having credentials in your code. 

In this article, you learn how to enable and remove MSI for an Azure VM, using an Azure SDK.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [msi-qs-configure-prereqs](../../../includes/active-directory-msi-qs-configure-prereqs.md)]

## Azure SDKs with MSI support 

Azure supports multiple programming platforms through a series of [Azure SDKs](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads). Several of them have been updated to support MSI, and provide corresponding samples to demonstrate usage. This list is updated as additional support is added:

| SDK | Sample |
| --- | ------ | 
| .NET   | [Manage resource from an MSI-enabled VM](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/aad-dotnet-manage-resources-from-vm-with-msi/) |
| Java   | [Manage storage from an MSI-enabled VM](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/compute-java-manage-resources-from-vm-with-msi-in-aad-group/)|
| Node.js| [Create a VM with MSI enabled](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/compute-node-msi-vm/) |
| Python | [Create a VM with MSI enabled](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/compute-python-msi-vm/) |
| Ruby   | [Create Azure VM with an MSI](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/compute-ruby-msi-vm/) |
