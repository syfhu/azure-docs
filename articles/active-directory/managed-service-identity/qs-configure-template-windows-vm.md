# Configure a VM Managed Service Identity by using a template

[!INCLUDE[preview-notice](../../../includes/active-directory-msi-preview-notice.md)]

Managed Service Identity provides Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory. You can use this identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, without having credentials in your code. 

In this article, you learn how to perform the following Managed Service Identity operations on an Azure VM, using Azure Resource Manager deployment template:

## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with Managed Service Identity, check out the [overview section](overview.md). **Be sure to review the [difference between a system assigned and user assigned identity](overview.md#how-does-it-work)**.
- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before continuing.

## Azure Resource Manager templates

As with the Azure portal and scripting, [Azure Resource Manager](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md) templates provide the ability to deploy new or modified resources defined by an Azure resource group. Several options are available for template editing and deployment, both local and portal-based, including:

   - Using a [custom template from the Azure Marketplace](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy-portal.md#deploy-resources-from-custom-template), which allows you to create a template from scratch, or base it on an existing common or [QuickStart template](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/templates/).
   - Deriving from an existing resource group, by exporting a template from either [the original deployment](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-export-template.md#view-template-from-deployment-history), or from the [current state of the deployment](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-export-template.md#export-the-template-from-resource-group).
   - Using a local [JSON editor (such as VS Code)](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-create-first-template.md), and then uploading and deploying by using PowerShell or CLI.
   - Using the Visual Studio [Azure Resource Group project](../../azure-resource-manager/vs-azure-tools-resource-groups-deployment-projects-create-deploy.md) to both create and deploy a template.  

Regardless of the option you choose, template syntax is the same during initial deployment and redeployment. Enabling a system or user assigned identity on a new or existing VM is done in the same manner. Also, by default, Azure Resource Manager does an [incremental update](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy.md#incremental-and-complete-deployments) to deployments.

## System assigned identity

In this section, you will enable and disable a system assigned identity using an Azure Resource Manager template.

### Enable system assigned identity during creation of an Azure VM, or on an existing VM

1. Whether you sign in to Azure locally or via the Azure portal, use an account that is associated with the Azure subscription that contains the VM. Also ensure that your account belongs to a role that gives you write permissions on the VM (for example, the role of “Virtual Machine Contributor”).

2. After loading the template into an editor, locate the `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines` resource of interest within the `resources` section. Yours might look slightly different from the following screenshot, depending on the editor you're using and whether you are editing a template for a new deployment or existing one.

   >[!NOTE] 
   > This example assumes variables such as `vmName`, `storageAccountName`, and `nicName` have been defined in the template.
   >

3. To enable system assigned identity, add the `"identity"` property at the same level as the `"type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines"` property. Use the following syntax:

   ```JSON
   "identity": { 
       "type": "systemAssigned"
   },
   ```

4. (Optional) Add the VM MSI extension as a `resources` element. This step is optional as you can use the Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) identity endpoint, to retrieve tokens as well.  Use the following syntax:

   >[!NOTE] 
   > The following example assumes a Windows VM extension (`ManagedIdentityExtensionForWindows`) is being deployed. You can also configure for Linux by using `ManagedIdentityExtensionForLinux` instead, for the `"name"` and `"type"` elements.
   >

   ```JSON
   { 
       "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions",
       "name": "[concat(variables('vmName'),'/ManagedIdentityExtensionForWindows')]",
       "apiVersion": "2016-03-30",
       "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
       "dependsOn": [
           "[concat('Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/', variables('vmName'))]"
       ],
       "properties": {
           "publisher": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity",
           "type": "ManagedIdentityExtensionForWindows",
           "typeHandlerVersion": "1.0",
           "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true,
           "settings": {
               "port": 50342
           },
           "protectedSettings": {}
       }
   }
   ```

5. When you're done, your template should look similar to the following:

   ![Screenshot of template after update](../media/msi-qs-configure-template-windows-vm/template-file-after.png)

### Disable a system assigned identity from an Azure VM

> [!NOTE]
> Disabling Managed Service Identity from a Virtual Machine is currently not supported. In the meantime, you can switch between using System Assigned and User Assigned Identities.

If you have a VM that no longer needs a managed service identity:

1. Whether you sign in to Azure locally or via the Azure portal, use an account that is associated with the Azure subscription that contains the VM. Also ensure that your account belongs to a role that gives you write permissions on the VM (for example, the role of “Virtual Machine Contributor”).

2. Change the identity type to `UserAssigned`.

## User assigned identity

In this section, you assign a user assigned identity to an Azure VM using Azure Resource Manager template.

> [!Note]
> To create a user assigned identity using an Azure Resource Manager Template, see [Create a user assigned identity](how-to-manage-ua-identity-arm.md#create-a-user-assigned-identity).

 ### Assign a user assigned identity to an Azure VM

1. Under the `resources` element, add the following entry to assign a user assigned identity to your VM.  Be sure to replace `<USERASSIGNEDIDENTITY>` with the name of the user assigned identity you created.
    ```json
    {
        "apiVersion": "2017-12-01",
        "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines",
        "name": "[variables('vmName')]",
        "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
        "identity": {
            "type": "userAssigned",
            "identityIds": [
                "[resourceID('Micrososft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/',variables('<USERASSIGNEDIDENTITYNAME>'))]"
            ]
        },
    ```
    
2. (Optional) Next, under the `resources` element, add the following entry to assign the managed identity extension to your VM. This step is optional as you can use the Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) identity endpoint, to retrieve tokens as well. Use the following syntax:
    ```json
    {
        "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions",
        "name": "[concat(variables('vmName'),'/ManagedIdentityExtensionForWindows')]",
        "apiVersion": "2015-05-01-preview",
        "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
        "dependsOn": [
            "[concat('Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/', variables('vmName'))]"
        ],
        "properties": {
            "publisher": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity",
            "type": "ManagedIdentityExtensionForWindows",
            "typeHandlerVersion": "1.0",
            "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true,
            "settings": {
                "port": 50342
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    
3.  When you are done, your template should look similar to the following:
