# Create, list or delete a user assigned Managed Service Identity (MSI) using the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE[preview-notice](~/includes/active-directory-msi-preview-notice-ua.md)]

Managed Service Identity provides Azure services with a managed identity in Azure Active Directory. You can use this identity to authenticate to services that support Azure AD authentication, without needing credentials in your code. 

At this time, it is not possible to create, list, or delete a user assigned managed identity using the Azure portal.  Check back for updates.
