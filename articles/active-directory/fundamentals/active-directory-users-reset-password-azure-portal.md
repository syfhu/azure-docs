# Reset the password for a user in Azure Active Directory

Administrators may need to reset a user's password in cases where they forgot, were locked out, or other scenarios. The steps that follow guide you through resetting a user's password.

## How to reset the password for a user

1. Sign in to the [Azure AD Admin Center](https://aad.portal.azure.com) with an account that has directory permissions to reset user passwords.
2. Select  **Azure Active Directory** > **Users and groups** > **All users**.
3. Select the user you would like to reset the password for.
2. For the selected user, select **Reset password**.

6. On **Reset password**, select **Reset password**.
7. A temporary password is displayed that you can then provide to the user. The user will be asked to then change their password the next time they logon. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > This temporary password does not have an expiration time so it will be valid until they log in and are then are forced to change it.
