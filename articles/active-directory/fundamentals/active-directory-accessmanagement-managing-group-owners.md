# Managing owners for a group
Once a resource owner has assigned access to a resource to an Azure AD group, the membership of the group is managed by the group owner. The resource owner effectively delegates the permission to assign users to the resource to the owner of the group.

## Add an owner to a group

1. In the [Azure AD admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com), select **Users and groups**.
2. Select **All groups**, and then open the group that you want to add owners to.
3. Select **Add Owners**.
4. On the **Add owners** page, select the user that you want to add as the owner of this group, and make sure this name is added to the **Selected** pane.

## Remove an owner from a group

1. In the [Azure AD admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com), select **Users and groups**.
2. Select **All groups**, and then open the group from which you want to remove owners.
3. Select the **Owners** tab.
4. Select the owner that you want to remove from this group, and then select **Remove**.
