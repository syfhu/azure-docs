# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with RedBrick Health

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate RedBrick Health with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating RedBrick Health with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to RedBrick Health.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to RedBrick Health (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with RedBrick Health, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A RedBrick Health single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding RedBrick Health from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding RedBrick Health from the gallery
To configure the integration of RedBrick Health into Azure AD, you need to add RedBrick Health from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add RedBrick Health from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **RedBrick Health**, select **RedBrick Health** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![RedBrick Health in the results list](./media/redbrickhealth-tutorial/tutorial_redbrickhealth_addfromgallery.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with RedBrick Health based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in RedBrick Health is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in RedBrick Health needs to be established.

In RedBrick Health, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with RedBrick Health, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Create a RedBrick Health test user](#create-a-redbrick-health-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in RedBrick Health that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your RedBrick Health application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with RedBrick Health, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **RedBrick Health** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/redbrickhealth-tutorial/tutorial_redbrickhealth_samlbase.png)

3. On the **RedBrick Health Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![RedBrick Health Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/redbrickhealth-tutorial/tutorial_redbrickhealth_url.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL: `http://www.redbrickhealth.com`
	
	b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL: `https://sso-intg.redbrickhealth.com/sp/ACS.saml2`
	
	For Production Environment: `https://sso.redbrickhealth.com/sp/ACS.saml2`

	c. Click **Show advanced URL settings**.
	
	![RedBrick Health Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/redbrickhealth-tutorial/tutorial_redbrickhealth_url1.png)

	d. In the **Relay State** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://api-sso2.redbricktest.com/identity/sso/nbound?target=https://vanity9-sso2.redbrickdev.com/portal&connection=<companyname>conn1`
	
	> [!NOTE] 
	> Relay State value is not real. Update this value with the actual Relay State. Contact [RedBrick Health support team](https://home.redbrickhealth.com/contact/) to get this value.

4. The RedBrick Health application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. These claims are customer specific and depends on your requirement. Following optional claims are example only which you can configure for your application. You can manage the values of these attributes from the **User Attributes** section on application integration page.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/redbrickhealth-tutorial/attribute.png)

5. In the **User Attributes** section on the **Single sign-on** dialog, configure SAML token attribute as shown in the image above and perform the following steps:

	| Attribute Name | Attribute Value |
	| ---------------| ----------------|
	| principal name | ********** |
	| client id | ********** |
	| participant id | ********** |
	
	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are for reference purpose only. You need to define the attributes as per your organization's requirement. Please contact [RedBrick Health support team](https://home.redbrickhealth.com/contact/) to get more info about the required claims.
	
	a. Click **Add attribute** to open the **Add Attribute** dialog.
	
	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/redbrickhealth-tutorial/tutorial_attribute_04.png)
	
	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/redbrickhealth-tutorial/tutorial_attribute_05.png)
	
	b. In the **Name** textbox, type the attribute name shown for that row.
	
	c. From the **Value** list, type the attribute value shown for that row.

	d. Leave the **Namespace** blank.
	
	e. Click **Ok**.

6. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Certificate(Base64)** and then save the certificate file on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](./media/redbrickhealth-tutorial/tutorial_redbrickhealth_certificate.png) 

7. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On Save button](./media/redbrickhealth-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)

8. On the **RedBrick Health Configuration** section, click **Configure RedBrick Health** to open **Configure sign-on** window. Copy the **SAML Entity ID** from the **Quick Reference section.**

	![RedBrick Health Configuration](./media/redbrickhealth-tutorial/tutorial_redbrickhealth_configure.png) 

9. To configure single sign-on on **RedBrick Health** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate(Base64)** and **SAML Entity ID** to [RedBrick Health support team](https://home.redbrickhealth.com/contact/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

> [!TIP]
> You can now read a concise version of these instructions inside the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), while you are setting up the app!  After adding this app from the **Active Directory > Enterprise Applications** section, simply click the **Single Sign-On** tab and access the embedded documentation through the **Configuration** section at the bottom. You can read more about the embedded documentation feature here: [Azure AD embedded documentation]( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=845985)
