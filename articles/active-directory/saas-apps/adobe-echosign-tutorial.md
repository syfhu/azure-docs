# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Adobe Sign

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Adobe Sign with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Adobe Sign with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Adobe Sign.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Adobe Sign (single sign-on) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location--the Azure portal.

For more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory?](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Adobe Sign, you need:

- An Azure AD subscription
- An Adobe Sign single sign-on enabled subscription

To test the steps in this tutorial, follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Adobe Sign from the gallery.
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on.

## Add Adobe Sign from the gallery
To configure the integration of Adobe Sign into Azure AD, you need to add Adobe Sign from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), in the left pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** icon.

2. Browse to **Enterprise applications** > **All applications**.

	![Screenshot of Azure Active Directory menus, with Enterprise applications and All applications highlighted][2]
	
3. To add a new application, select **New application** at the top of the dialog box.

	![Screenshot of New application option at the top of the dialog box][3]

4. In the search box, type **Adobe Sign**.

	![Screenshot of search box](./media/adobe-echosign-tutorial/tutorial_adobesign_search.png)

5. In the results panel, select **Adobe Sign**, and then select **Add**.

	![Screenshot of results panel](./media/adobe-echosign-tutorial/tutorial_adobesign_addfromgallery.png)

##  Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Adobe Sign, based on a test user called "Britta Simon."

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to recognize a linked relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Adobe Sign.

To establish the linked relationship, in Adobe Sign, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username**.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Adobe Sign, complete the following building blocks:

1. [Configure Azure AD single sign-on](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on) to enable your users to use this feature.
2. [Create an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user) to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. [Create an Adobe Sign test user](#creating-an-adobe-sign-test-user) to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Adobe Sign who is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. [Assign the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user) to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. [Test single sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on) to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal, and configure single sign-on in your Adobe Sign application.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Adobe Sign** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

	![Screenshot of Adobe Sign application integration page, with Single sign-on highlighted][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog box, for **Mode**, select **SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.

	![Screenshot of Single sign-on dialog box, with Mode box highlighted](./media/adobe-echosign-tutorial/tutorial_adobesign_samlbase.png)

3. In the **Adobe Sign Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![Screenshot of Adobe Sign Domain and URLs section](./media/adobe-echosign-tutorial/tutorial_adobesign_url.png)

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL that uses the following pattern: `https://<companyname>.echosign.com/`

	b. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL that uses the following pattern: `https://<companyname>.echosign.com`

	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual sign-on URL and identifier. Contact [Adobe Sign Client support team](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/contact/support.html) to get these values.

4. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select **Certificate(Base64)**, and then save the certificate file on your computer.

	![Screenshot of SAML Signing Certificate section](./media/adobe-echosign-tutorial/tutorial_adobesign_certificate.png) 

5. Select **Save**.

	![Screenshot of Save button](./media/adobe-echosign-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)

6. In the **Adobe Sign Configuration** section, select **Configure Adobe Sign** to open the **Configure sign-on** window. Copy the **Sign-Out URL**, **SAML Entity ID**, and **SAML Single Sign-On Service URL** from the **Quick Reference** section.

	![Screenshot of Adobe Sign Configuration section, with Configure Adobe Sign highlighted](./media/adobe-echosign-tutorial/tutorial_adobesign_configure.png)

7. Before configuration, contact the [Adobe Sign Client support team](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/contact/support.html) to whitelist your domain in the Adobe Sign. Here's how to add the domain:

	a. The [Adobe Sign Client support team](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/contact/support.html) sends you a randomly generated token. For your domain, the token will be like the following: **adobe-sign-verification= xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx**

	b. Publish the verification token in a DNS text record, and notify the [Adobe Sign Client support team](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/contact/support.html).
	
	> [!NOTE]
	> This can take a few days, or longer. Note that DNS propagation delays mean that a value published in DNS might not be visible for an hour or more. Your IT administrator should be knowledgeable about how to publish this token in a DNS text record.
	
	c. When you notify the [Adobe Sign Client support team](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/contact/support.html) through the support ticket, after the token is published, they validate the domain and add it to your account.
	
	d. Generally, here's how to publish the token on a DNS record:

	* Sign in to your domain account
	* Find the page for updating the DNS record. This page might be called DNS Management, Name Server Management, or Advanced Settings.
	* Find the TXT records for your domain.
	* Add a TXT record with the full token value supplied by Adobe.
	* Save your changes.

8. In a different web browser window, sign in to your Adobe Sign company site as an administrator.

9. In the SAML menu, select **Account Settings** > **SAML Settings**.

    a. Under **SAML Mode**, select **SAML Mandatory**.
   
    b. Select **Allow Echosign Account Administrators to log in using their Echosign Credentials**.
   
    c. Under **User Creation**, select **Automatically add users authenticated through SAML**.

	d. Paste **SAML Entity ID**, which you have copied from the Azure portal into the **Entity ID/Issuer URL** text box.
   	
	e. Paste **SAML Single Sign-On Service URL**, which you have copied from Azure portal into the **Login URL/SSO Endpoint** text box.
   
    f. Paste **Sign-Out URL**, which you have copied from the Azure portal into the **Logout URL/SLO Endpoint** text box.

	g. Open your downloaded **Certificate(Base64)** file in Notepad. Copy the content of it into your clipboard, and then paste it to the **IdP Certificate** text box.

	h. Select **Save Changes**.
