# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with People

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate People with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating People with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to People
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to People (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with People, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A People single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding People from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding People from the gallery
To configure the integration of People into Azure AD, you need to add People from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add People from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![Active Directory][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![Applications][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![Applications][3]

4. In the search box, type **People**.

5. In the results panel, select **People**, and then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Creating an Azure AD test user](./media/people-tutorial/tutorial_people_addfromgallery.png)

##  Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with People based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in People is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in People needs to be established.

In People, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with People, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a People test user](#creating-a-people-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in People that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your People application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with People, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **People** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure Single Sign-On][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/people-tutorial/tutorial_people_samlbase.png)

3. On the **People Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/people-tutorial/tutorial_people_url.png)

	a. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:  `https://<company name>.peoplehr.net`

    b. In the **Identifier** textbox, type the URL: `https://www.peoplehr.com`

	c. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:  `https://<company name>.peoplehr.net/Pages/Saml/ConsumeAzureAD.aspx`
	
	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Reply URL and Sign-On URL. Contact [People Client support team](mailto:customerservices@peoplehr.com) to get these values. 

5. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the metadata file on your computer.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/people-tutorial/tutorial_people_certificate.png) 

6. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/people-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)
	
7. To get SSO configured for your application, you need to sign-on to your People tenant as an administrator.
   
8. In the menu on the left side, click **Settings**.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/people-tutorial/tutorial_people_001.png)

9. Click **Company**.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/people-tutorial/tutorial_people_002.png)

10. On the **Upload 'Single Sign On' SAML meta-data file**, click **Browse** to upload the downloaded metadata file.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/people-tutorial/tutorial_people_003.png)

> [!TIP]
> You can now read a concise version of these instructions inside the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), while you are setting up the app!  After adding this app from the **Active Directory > Enterprise Applications** section, simply click the **Single Sign-On** tab and access the embedded documentation through the **Configuration** section at the bottom. You can read more about the embedded documentation feature here: [Azure AD embedded documentation]( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=845985)
