# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Dropbox for Business

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Dropbox for Business with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Dropbox for Business with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Dropbox for Business.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Dropbox for Business (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Dropbox for Business, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Dropbox for Business single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Dropbox for Business from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Dropbox for Business from the gallery
To configure the integration of Dropbox for Business into Azure AD, you need to add Dropbox for Business from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Dropbox for Business from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **Dropbox for Business**, select **Dropbox for Business** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Dropbox for Business based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Dropbox for Business is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Dropbox for Business needs to be established.

In Dropbox for Business, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Dropbox for Business, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Create a Dropbox for Business test user](#create-a-dropbox-for-business-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Dropbox for Business that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Dropbox for Business application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Dropbox for Business, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Dropbox for Business** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
