# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with UserVoice

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate UserVoice with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating UserVoice with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to UserVoice.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to UserVoice (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with UserVoice, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A UserVoice single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding UserVoice from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding UserVoice from the gallery
To configure the integration of UserVoice into Azure AD, you need to add UserVoice from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add UserVoice from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **UserVoice**, select **UserVoice** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![UserVoice in the results list](./media/uservoice-tutorial/tutorial_uservoice_addfromgallery.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with UserVoice based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in UserVoice is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in UserVoice needs to be established.

In UserVoice, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with UserVoice, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Create a UserVoice test user](#create-a-uservoice-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in UserVoice that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your UserVoice application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with UserVoice, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **UserVoice** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/uservoice-tutorial/tutorial_uservoice_samlbase.png)

3. On the **UserVoice Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![UserVoice Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/uservoice-tutorial/tutorial_uservoice_url.png)

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<tenantname>.UserVoice.com`

	b. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<tenantname>.UserVoice.com`

	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign-On URL and Identifier. Contact [UserVoice Client support team](https://www.uservoice.com/) to get these values.

4. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, copy the **THUMBPRINT** value of certificate.

	![The Certificate download link](./media/uservoice-tutorial/tutorial_uservoice_certificate.png) 

5. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On Save button](./media/uservoice-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)

6. On the **UserVoice Configuration** section, click **Configure UserVoice** to open **Configure sign-on** window. Copy the **Sign-Out URL, and SAML Single Sign-On Service URL** from the **Quick Reference section.**

	![UserVoice Configuration](./media/uservoice-tutorial/tutorial_uservoice_configure.png) 

7. In a different web browser window, log in to your UserVoice company site as an administrator.

8. In the toolbar on the top, click **Settings**, and then select **Web portal** from the menu.
   
    ![Settings Section On App Side](./media/uservoice-tutorial/ic777519.png "Settings")

9. On the **Web portal** tab, in the **User authentication** section, click **Edit** to open the **Edit User Authentication** dialog page.
   
    ![Web portal Tab](./media/uservoice-tutorial/ic777520.png "Web portal")

10. On the **Edit User Authentication** dialog page, perform the following steps:
   
    ![Edit user authentication](./media/uservoice-tutorial/ic777521.png "Edit user authentication")
   
    a. Click **Single Sign-On (SSO)**.
 
    b. Paste the **SAML Single Sign-On Service URL** value, which you have copied from the Azure portal into the **SSO Remote Sign-In** textbox.

    c. Paste the **Sign-Out URL** value, which you have copied from the Azure portal into the **SSO Remote Sign-Out textbox**.
 
    d. Paste the **Thumbprint** value , which you have copied from Azure portal  into the **Current certificate SHA1 fingerprint** textbox.
	
	e. Click **Save authentication settings**.

> [!TIP]
> You can now read a concise version of these instructions inside the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), while you are setting up the app!  After adding this app from the **Active Directory > Enterprise Applications** section, simply click the **Single Sign-On** tab and access the embedded documentation through the **Configuration** section at the bottom. You can read more about the embedded documentation feature here: [Azure AD embedded documentation]( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=845985)
