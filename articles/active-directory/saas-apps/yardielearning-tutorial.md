# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Yardi eLearning

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Yardi eLearning with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Yardi eLearning with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Yardi eLearning
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Yardi eLearning (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Yardi eLearning, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Yardi eLearning single-sign on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Yardi eLearning from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Yardi eLearning from the gallery
To configure the integration of Yardi eLearning into Azure AD, you need to add Yardi eLearning from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Yardi eLearning from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![Active Directory][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![Applications][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![Applications][3]

4. In the search box, type **Yardi eLearning**.

5. In the results panel, select **Yardi eLearning**, and then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Creating an Azure AD test user](./media/yardielearning-tutorial/tutorial_yardielearning_addfromgallery.png)

##  Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Yardi eLearning based on a test user called "Britta Simon."

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Yardi eLearning is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Yardi eLearning needs to be established.

In Yardi eLearning, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Yardi eLearning, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a Yardi eLearning test user](#creating-a-yardi-elearning-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Yardi eLearning that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Yardi eLearning application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Yardi eLearning, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Yardi eLearning** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure Single Sign-On][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/yardielearning-tutorial/tutorial_yardielearning_samlbase.png)

3. On the **Yardi eLearning Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/yardielearning-tutorial/tutorial_yardielearning_url.png)

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<companyname>.yardielearning.com/login`

	b. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<companyname>.yardielearning.com/trust`

	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign-On URL and Identifier. Contact [Yardi eLearning Client support team](mailto:elearning@yardi.com) to get these values. 
 
4. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the metadata file on your computer.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/yardielearning-tutorial/tutorial_yardielearning_certificate.png) 

5. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/yardielearning-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)

8. To configure single sign-on on **Yardi eLearning** side, you need to send the downloaded **Metadata XML** to [Yardi eLearning support team](mailto:elearning@yardi.com). 

> [!TIP]
> You can now read a concise version of these instructions inside the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), while you are setting up the app!  After adding this app from the **Active Directory > Enterprise Applications** section, simply click the **Single Sign-On** tab and access the embedded documentation through the **Configuration** section at the bottom. You can read more about the embedded documentation feature here: [Azure AD embedded documentation]( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=845985)
