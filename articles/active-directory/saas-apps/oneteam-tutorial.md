# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Oneteam

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Oneteam with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Oneteam with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Oneteam
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Oneteam (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Oneteam, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Oneteam single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Oneteam from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Oneteam from the gallery
To configure the integration of Oneteam into Azure AD, you need to add Oneteam from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Oneteam from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![Active Directory][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![Applications][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![Applications][3]

4. In the search box, type **Oneteam**.

5. In the results panel, select **Oneteam**, and then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Creating an Azure AD test user](./media/oneteam-tutorial/tutorial_oneteam_addfromgallery.png)

##  Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Oneteam based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Oneteam is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Oneteam needs to be established.

In Oneteam, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Oneteam, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a Oneteam test user](#creating-a-oneteam-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Oneteam that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Oneteam application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Oneteam, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Oneteam** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure Single Sign-On][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/oneteam-tutorial/tutorial_oneteam_samlbase.png)

3. On the **Oneteam Domain and URLs** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode:

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/oneteam-tutorial/tutorial_oneteam_url.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://api.one-team.io/teams/<team name>`

	b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://api.one-team.io/teams/<team name>/auth/saml/callback`

4. Check **Show advanced URL settings**, if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/oneteam-tutorial/tutorial_oneteam_url1.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<team name>.one-team.io/`
	 
	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL, and Sign-On URL. Contact [Oneteam Client support team](https://support.one-team.com/hc/requests/new) to get these values. 



5. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the metadata file on your computer.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/oneteam-tutorial/tutorial_oneteam_certificate.png) 

6. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/oneteam-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)
	
7. To get SSO configured for your application, you can raise the support ticket with [Oneteam support team](https://support.one-team.com/hc/requests/new) and provide them the downloaded **Metadata**. 

> [!TIP]
> You can now read a concise version of these instructions inside the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), while you are setting up the app!  After adding this app from the **Active Directory > Enterprise Applications** section, simply click the **Single Sign-On** tab and access the embedded documentation through the **Configuration** section at the bottom. You can read more about the embedded documentation feature here: [Azure AD embedded documentation]( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=845985)

### Creating a Oneteam test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called Britta Simon in Oneteam. Oneteam supports just-in-time provisioning, which is by default enabled.

There is no action item for you in this section. A new user will be created during an attempt to access Oneteam, if it doesn't exist yet.

>[!NOTE]
>If you need to create an user manually, you can raise the support ticket with [Oneteam support team](https://support.one-team.com/hc/requests/new).

### Assigning the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Oneteam.

![Assign User][200] 

**To assign Britta Simon to Oneteam, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, open the applications view, and then navigate to the directory view and go to **Enterprise applications** then click **All applications**.

	![Assign User][201] 

2. In the applications list, select **Oneteam**.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/oneteam-tutorial/tutorial_oneteam_app.png) 

3. In the menu on the left, click **Users and groups**.

	![Assign User][202] 

4. Click **Add** button. Then select **Users and groups** on **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![Assign User][203]

5. On **Users and groups** dialog, select **Britta Simon** in the Users list.

6. Click **Select** button on **Users and groups** dialog.

7. Click **Assign** button on **Add Assignment** dialog.
	
### Testing single sign-on

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Oneteam tile in the Access Panel, you should get automatically signed-on to your Oneteam application.
For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](../active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction.md).
