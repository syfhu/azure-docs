# Tutorial: Configure Cisco Webex for automatic user provisioning


The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate the steps to be performed in Cisco Webex and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure Azure AD to automatically provision and de-provision users to Cisco Webex.


> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial describes a connector built on top of the Azure AD User Provisioning Service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../active-directory-saas-app-provisioning.md).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

*   An Azure AD tenant
*   A Cisco Webex tenant
*   A user account in Cisco Webex with Admin permissions


> [!NOTE]
> The Azure AD provisioning integration relies on the [Cisco Webex Webservice](https://developer.webex.com/getting-started.html), which is available to Cisco Webex teams.

## Adding Cisco Webex from the gallery
Before configuring Cisco Webex for automatic user provisioning with Azure AD, you need to add Cisco Webex from the Azure AD application gallery to your list of managed SaaS applications.

**To add Cisco Webex from the Azure AD application gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click on the **Azure Active Directory** icon.

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications** > **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications Section][2]

3. To add Cisco Webex, click the **New application** button on the top of the dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **Cisco Webex**.

5. In the results panel, select **Cisco Webex**, and then click the **Add** button to add Cisco Webex to your list of SaaS applications.

## Assigning users to Cisco Webex

Azure Active Directory uses a concept called "assignments" to determine which users should receive access to selected apps. In the context of automatic user provisioning, only the users and/or groups that have been "assigned" to an application in Azure AD are synchronized.

Before configuring and enabling automatic user provisioning, you should decide which users in Azure AD need access to Cisco Webex. Once decided, you can assign these users to Cisco Webex by following the instructions here:

*   [Assign a user or group to an enterprise app](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md)

### Important tips for assigning users to Cisco Webex

*	It is recommended that a single Azure AD user is assigned to Cisco Webex to test the automatic user provisioning configuration. Additional users may be assigned later.

*	When assigning a user to Cisco Webex, you must select any valid application-specific role (if available) in the assignment dialog. Users with the **Default Access** role are excluded from provisioning.

## Configuring automatic user provisioning to Cisco Webex

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users in Cisco Webex based on user assignments in Azure AD.


### To configure automatic user provisioning for Cisco Webex in Azure AD:


1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and browse to **Azure Active Directory > Enterprise applications > All applications**.

2. Select Cisco Webex from your list of SaaS applications.

	![Cisco Webex Provisioning](./media/cisco-webex-provisioning-tutorial/Successcenter2.png)

3. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Cisco Webex Provisioning](./media/cisco-webex-provisioning-tutorial/ProvisioningTab.png)

4. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Cisco Webex Provisioning](./media/cisco-webex-provisioning-tutorial/ProvisioningCredentials.png)

5. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input the **Tenant URL**, and **Secret Token** of your Cisco Webex's account.

	*   In the **Tenant URL** field, populate the Cisco Webex SCIM API URL for your tenant, which takes the form of `https://api.webex.com/v1/scim/[Tenant ID]/`, where `[Tenant ID]` is an alphanumeric string as described in step 6.

	*   In the **Secret Token** field, populate the Secret Token as described in step 6.

1. The **Tenant ID** and **Secret Token** for your Cisco Webex account can be found by logging into the [Cisco Webex developer site](https://developer.webex.com/) with your Admin account. Once logged in -
	* Go to the [Getting Started page](https://developer.webex.com/getting-started.html)
	* Scroll down to the [Authentication Section](https://developer.webex.com/getting-started.html#authentication)
	![Cisco Webex Authentication Token](./media/cisco-webex-provisioning-tutorial/SecretToken.png)
	* The alphanumeric string in the box is your **Secret Token**. Copy this token to the clipboard
	* Go to the [Get My Own Details page](https://developer.webex.com/endpoint-people-me-get.html)
		* Make sure that Test Mode is ON
		* Type the word "Bearer" followed by a space, and then paste the Secret Token into the Authorization field
    ![Cisco Webex Authentication Token](./media/cisco-webex-provisioning-tutorial/GetMyDetails.png)
		* Click Run
	* In the response text to the right, the **Tenant ID** appears as "orgId":

	```json
	{
		"id": "(...)",
		"emails": [
			"admin.user@contoso.com"
		],
		"displayName": "John Smith",
		"nickName": "John",
		"orgId": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
		(...)
	}
	```

1. Upon populating the fields shown in Step 5, click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to Cisco Webex. If the connection fails, ensure your Cisco Webex account has Admin permissions and try again.

8. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and check the checkbox - **Send an email notification when a failure occurs**.

	![Cisco Webex Provisioning](./media/cisco-webex-provisioning-tutorial/EmailNotification.png)

9. Click **Save**.

10. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Cisco Webex**.

	![Cisco Webex Provisioning](./media/cisco-webex-provisioning-tutorial/UserMapping.png)

11. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Cisco Webex in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Cisco Webex for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

	![Cisco Webex Provisioning](./media/cisco-webex-provisioning-tutorial/UserMappingAttributes.png)

12. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](../active-directory-saas-scoping-filters.md).

13. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Cisco Webex, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Cisco Webex Provisioning](./media/cisco-webex-provisioning-tutorial/ProvisioningStatus.png)

14. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to Cisco Webex by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Cisco Webex Provisioning](./media/cisco-webex-provisioning-tutorial/SyncScope.png)

15. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Cisco Webex Provisioning](./media/cisco-webex-provisioning-tutorial/Save.png)


This operation starts the initial synchronization of all users and/or groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial sync takes longer to perform than subsequent syncs, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running. You can use the **Synchronization Details** section to monitor progress and follow links to provisioning activity report, which describes all actions performed by the Azure AD provisioning service on Cisco Webex.
