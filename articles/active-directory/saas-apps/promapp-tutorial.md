# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Promapp

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Promapp with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Promapp with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Promapp
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Promapp (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Promapp, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Promapp single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Promapp from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Promapp from the gallery
To configure the integration of Promapp into Azure AD, you need to add Promapp from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Promapp from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![Active Directory][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![Applications][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![Applications][3]

4. In the search box, type **Promapp**.

5. In the results panel, select **Promapp**, and then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Creating an Azure AD test user](./media/promapp-tutorial/tutorial_promapp_addfromgallery.png)

##  Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Promapp based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Promapp is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Promapp needs to be established.

In Promapp, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Promapp, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a Promapp test user](#creating-a-promapp-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Promapp that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Promapp application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Promapp, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Promapp** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure Single Sign-On][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/promapp-tutorial/tutorial_promapp_samlbase.png)

3. On the **Promapp Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode:

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/promapp-tutorial/tutorial_promapp_url.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
	| |
	|--|
	| `https://go.promapp.com/TENANTNAME/`|
	| `https://au.promapp.com/TENANTNAME/`|
	| `https://us.promapp.com/TENANTNAME/`|
	| `https://eu.promapp.com/TENANTNAME/`|
	| `https://ca.promapp.com/TENANTNAME/`|
	
	> [!NOTE] 
	> Presently Azure AD integration with Promapp has only been configured for service initiated authentication e.g. going to a Promapp URL initiates the authentication process. However the Reply URL is a required field.
	
	b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://DOMAINNAME.promapp.com/azuread/saml/authenticate.aspx`

4. Check **Show advanced URL settings** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/promapp-tutorial/tutorial_promapp_url1.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://DOMAINNAME.promapp.com/TENANTNAME/saml/authenticate`

	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign-On URL, Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [Promapp Client support team](https://www.promapp.com/about-us/contact-us/) to get these values.

5. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Certificate(Base64)** and then save the certificate file on your computer.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/promapp-tutorial/tutorial_promapp_certificate.png) 

6. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/promapp-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)

7. On the **Promapp Configuration** section, click **Configure Promapp** to open **Configure sign-on** window. Copy the **SAML Single Sign-On Service URL** from the **Quick Reference section.**

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/promapp-tutorial/tutorial_promapp_configure.png) 

8. Sign-on to your Promapp company site as administrator. 

9. In the menu on the top, click **Admin**. 
   
    ![Azure AD Single Sign-On][12]

10. Click **Configure**. 
   
    ![Azure AD Single Sign-On][13]

11. On the **Security** dialog, perform the following steps:
   
    ![Azure AD Single Sign-On][14]
	
	a. Paste **SAML Single Sign-On Service URL**, which you have copied from the Azure portal into the **SSO-Login URL** textbox.
	
	b. As **SSO - Single Sign-on Mode**, select **Optional**, and then click **Save**.

	> [!NOTE]
	> **Optional** mode is for testing only. Once you are happy with the configuration, Select **Required** mode to enforce all users to authenticate using Azure AD.

	c. Open the downloaded certificate in notepad, copy the certificate content without the first line (-----**BEGIN CERTIFICATE**-----) and the last line (-----**END CERTIFICATE**-----), paste it into the **SSO-x.509 Certificate** textbox, and then click **Save**.
