# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with MaxxPoint

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate MaxxPoint with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating MaxxPoint with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to MaxxPoint
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to MaxxPoint (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with MaxxPoint, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A MaxxPoint single-sign on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- You should not use your production environment, unless this is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding MaxxPoint from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on


## Adding MaxxPoint from the gallery
To configure the integration of MaxxPoint into Azure AD, you need to add MaxxPoint from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add MaxxPoint from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![Active Directory][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![Applications][2]
	
3. Click **New application** button on the top of dialog to add new application.

	![Applications][3]

4. In the search box, type **MaxxPoint**.

5. In the results panel, select **MaxxPoint**, and then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Creating an Azure AD test user](./media/maxxpoint-tutorial/tutorial_maxxpoint_0001.png)

##  Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with MaxxPoint based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in MaxxPoint is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in MaxxPoint needs to be established.

This link relationship is established by assigning the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** in MaxxPoint.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with MaxxPoint, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a MaxxPoint test user](#creating-a-maxxpoint-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in MaxxPoint that is linked to the Azure AD representation of her.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your MaxxPoint application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with MaxxPoint, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **MaxxPoint** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure Single Sign-On][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/maxxpoint-tutorial/tutorial_general_300.png)

3. On the **MaxxPoint Domain and URLs** section, If you wish to configure the application in **IDP initiated mode**, no need to perform any steps.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/maxxpoint-tutorial/tutorial_maxxpoint_02.png)
	
4. On the **MaxxPoint Domain and URLs** section, If you wish to configure the application in **SP initiated mode**, perform the following steps:
	
	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/maxxpoint-tutorial/tutorial_maxxpoint_03.png)

	a. Click **Show advanced URL settings** option

	b. In the **Sign On URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://maxxpoint.westipc.com/default/sso/login/entity/<customer-id>-azure`

	> [!NOTE] 
	> Please note that this is not the real value. You have to update this value with the actual Sign On URL. Call MaxxPoint team on **888-728-0950** to get this value.

5. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the metadata file on your computer.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/maxxpoint-tutorial/tutorial_maxxpoint_06.png) 

6. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/maxxpoint-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)

7. To get SSO configured for your application, call MaxxPoint support team on **888-728-0950** and they'll assist you further on how to provide them the downloaded **Metadata XML** file. 

> [!TIP]
> You can now read a concise version of these instructions inside the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), while you are setting up the app!  After adding this app from the **Active Directory > Enterprise Applications** section, simply click **Single Sign-On** tab and access the embedded documentation through the **Configuration** section at the bottom. You can read more about the embedded documentation feature here: [Azure AD embedded documentation]( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=845985)
