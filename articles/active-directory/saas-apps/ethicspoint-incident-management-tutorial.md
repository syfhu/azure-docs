# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM)

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM) with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM) with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM)
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM) (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM), you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM) single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM) from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM) from the gallery
To configure the integration of EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM) into Azure AD, you need to add EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM) from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM) from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![Active Directory][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![Applications][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![Applications][3]

4. In the search box, type **EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM)**.

5. In the results panel, select **EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM)**, and then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Creating an Azure AD test user](./media/ethicspoint-incident-management-tutorial/tutorial_ethicspoint_addfromgallery.png)

##  Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM) based on a test user called "Britta Simon."

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM) is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM) needs to be established.

In EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM), assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM), you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM) test user](#creating-a-ethicspoint-incident-management-epim-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM) that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM) application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM), perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM)** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure Single Sign-On][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/ethicspoint-incident-management-tutorial/tutorial_ethicspoint_samlbase.png)

3. On the **EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM) Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/ethicspoint-incident-management-tutorial/tutorial_ethicspoint_url.png)

	a. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
	| |
	|--|
	| `https://<companyname>.navexglobal.com`|
	| `https://<companyname>.ethicspointvp.com`|

	b. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<companyname>.navexglobal.com/adfs/services/trust`

	c. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<servername>.navexglobal.com/adfs/ls/`

	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Reply URL, Identifier, and Sign-On URL. Contact [EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM) Client support team](http://www.navexglobal.com/company/contact-us) to get these values. 

4. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the metadata file on your computer.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/ethicspoint-incident-management-tutorial/tutorial_ethicspoint_certificate.png) 

5. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/ethicspoint-incident-management-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)
	
6. To configure single sign-on on **EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM)** side, you need to send the downloaded **Metadata XML** to [EthicsPoint Incident Management (EPIM) support team](http://www.navexglobal.com/company/contact-us).

> [!TIP]
> You can now read a concise version of these instructions inside the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), while you are setting up the app!  After adding this app from the **Active Directory > Enterprise Applications** section, simply click the **Single Sign-On** tab and access the embedded documentation through the **Configuration** section at the bottom. You can read more about the embedded documentation feature here: [Azure AD embedded documentation]( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=845985)
