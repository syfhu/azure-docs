# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Manabi Pocket

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Manabi Pocket with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Manabi Pocket with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Manabi Pocket.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Manabi Pocket (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Manabi Pocket, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Manabi Pocket single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Manabi Pocket from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Manabi Pocket from the gallery
To configure the integration of Manabi Pocket into Azure AD, you need to add Manabi Pocket from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Manabi Pocket from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **Manabi Pocket**, select **Manabi Pocket** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Manabi Pocket based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Manabi Pocket is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Manabi Pocket needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Manabi Pocket, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Create a Manabi Pocket test user](#create-a-manabi-pocket-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Manabi Pocket that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Manabi Pocket application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Manabi Pocket, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Manabi Pocket** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.

	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/manabipocket-tutorial/tutorial_manabipocket_samlbase.png)

3. On the **Manabi Pocket Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![Manabi Pocket Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/manabipocket-tutorial/tutorial_manabipocket_url.png)

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type the URL: `https://ed-cl.com/`

	b. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<SERVER-NAME>.ed-cl.com/<TENANT-ID>/idp/provider`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The Identifier value is not real. Update this value with the actual Identifier . Contact [Manabi Pocket Client support team](mailto:info-ed-cl@ntt.com) to get this value.

4. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the metadata file on your computer.

5. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On Save button](./media/manabipocket-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)

6. To configure single sign-on on **Manabi Pocket** side, you need to send the downloaded **Metadata XML** to [Manabi Pocket support team](mailto:info-ed-cl@ntt.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create an Azure AD test user

The objective of this section is to create a test user in the Azure portal called Britta Simon.

   ![Create an Azure AD test user][100]

**To create a test user in Azure AD, perform the following steps:**

### Create a Manabi Pocket test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Manabi Pocket. Work with [Manabi Pocket support team](mailto:info-ed-cl@ntt.com) to add the users in the Manabi Pocket platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Manabi Pocket.

![Assign the user role][200] 

**To assign Britta Simon to Manabi Pocket, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, open the applications view, and then navigate to the directory view and go to **Enterprise applications** then click **All applications**.

	![Assign User][201]
