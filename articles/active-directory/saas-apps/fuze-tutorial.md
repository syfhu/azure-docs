# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Fuze

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Fuze with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Fuze with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Fuze
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Fuze (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure Management portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Fuze, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Fuze single-sign on enabled subscription


> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.


To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- You should not use your production environment, unless this is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get an one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).


## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Fuze from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on


## Adding Fuze from the gallery
To configure the integration of Fuze into Azure AD, you need to add Fuze from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Fuze from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure Management Portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![Active Directory][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![Applications][2]
	
3. Click **Add** button on the top of the dialog.

	![Applications][3]

4. In the search box, type **Fuze**.

5. In the results panel, select **Fuze**, and then click **Add** button to add the application.

##  Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Fuze based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Fuze is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Fuze needs to be established.

This link relationship is established by assigning the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** in Fuze.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Fuze, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a Fuze test user](#creating-a-fuze-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Fuze that is linked to the Azure AD representation of her.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure Management portal and configure single sign-on in your Fuze application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Fuze, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure Management portal, on the **Fuze** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure Single Sign-On][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, as **Mode** select **SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign on.
 
	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/fuze-tutorial/tutorial_fuze_01.png)

3. On the **Fuze Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/fuze-tutorial/tutorial_fuze_020.png)
	
	In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type the Sign-on URL as: `https://www.thinkingphones.com/jetspeed/portal/`

4.  Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/fuze-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)

5. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the xml file on your computer.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/fuze-tutorial/tutorial_fuze_05.png) 

6. To configure single sign-on on **Fuze** side, you need to send the downloaded **Metadata XML** to [Fuze support team](https://www.fuze.com/support). They will set this up in order to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.


### Creating an Azure AD test user
The objective of this section is to create a test user in the Azure Management portal called Britta Simon.

![Create Azure AD User][100]

**To create a test user in Azure AD, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **Azure Management portal**, on the left navigation pane, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

	![Creating an Azure AD test user](./media/fuze-tutorial/create_aaduser_01.png) 

2. Go to **Users and groups** and click **All users** to display the list of users.
	
	![Creating an Azure AD test user](./media/fuze-tutorial/create_aaduser_02.png) 

3. At the top of the dialog click **Add** to open the **User** dialog.
 
	![Creating an Azure AD test user](./media/fuze-tutorial/create_aaduser_03.png) 

4. On the **User** dialog page, perform the following steps:
 
	![Creating an Azure AD test user](./media/fuze-tutorial/create_aaduser_04.png) 

    a. In the **Name** textbox, type **BrittaSimon**.

    b. In the **User name** textbox, type the **email address** of BrittaSimon.

	c. Select **Show Password** and write down the value of the **Password**.

    d. Click **Create**. 


### Creating a Fuze test user

Fuze application supports full Just in time user provision, so users will get created automatically when they sign-in. For any other clarification, please contact Fuze [support](https://www.fuze.com/support).

### Assigning the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting her access to Fuze.

![Assign User][200] 

**To assign Britta Simon to Fuze, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure Management portal, open the applications view, and then navigate to the directory view and go to **Enterprise applications** then click **All applications**.

	![Assign User][201] 

2. In the applications list, select **Fuze**.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/fuze-tutorial/tutorial_fuze_50.png) 

3. In the menu on the left, click **Users and groups**.

	![Assign User][202] 

4. Click **Add** button. Then select **Users and groups** on **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![Assign User][203]

5. On **Users and groups** dialog, select **Britta Simon** in the Users list.

6. Click **Select** button on **Users and groups** dialog.

7. Click **Assign** button on **Add Assignment** dialog.
	

### Testing single sign-on

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Fuze tile in the Access Panel, you should get automatically signed-on to your Fuze application.
