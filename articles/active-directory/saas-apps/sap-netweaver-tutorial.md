# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with SAP NetWeaver

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate SAP NetWeaver with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating SAP NetWeaver with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to SAP NetWeaver
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to SAP NetWeaver (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).


## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with SAP NetWeaver, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- An SAP NetWeaver single-sign on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding SAP NetWeaver from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding SAP NetWeaver from the gallery
To configure the integration of SAP NetWeaver into Azure AD, you need to add SAP NetWeaver from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add SAP NetWeaver from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![Active Directory][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![Applications][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![Applications][3]

4. In the search box, type **SAP NetWeaver**.

5. In the results panel, select **SAP NetWeaver**, and then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Creating an Azure AD test user](./media/sap-netweaver-tutorial/tutorial_sapnetweaver_addfromgallery.png)

##  Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SAP NetWeaver based on a test user called "Britta Simon."

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in SAP NetWeaver is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in SAP NetWeaver needs to be established.

This link relationship is established by assigning the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** in SAP NetWeaver.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SAP NetWeaver, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating an SAP NetWeaver test user](#creating-an-sap-netweaver-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in SAP NetWeaver that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your SAP NetWeaver application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with SAP NetWeaver, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **SAP NetWeaver** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure Single Sign-On][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/sap-netweaver-tutorial/tutorial_sapnetweaver_samlbase.png)

3. On the **SAP NetWeaver Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/sap-netweaver-tutorial/tutorial_sapnetweaver_url.png)

	a. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<your company instance of SAP NetWeaver>`

    b. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<your company instance of SAP NetWeaver>`

	c. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
	`https://<your company instance of SAP NetWeaver>/sap/saml2/sp/acs/100`
   	 
	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not the real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL and Sign-On URL. Here we suggest you to use the unique value of string in the Identifier. Contact [SAP NetWeaver Client support team](https://www.sap.com/support.html) to get these values. 

4. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the XML file on your computer.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/sap-netweaver-tutorial/tutorial_sapnetweaver_certificate.png) 

5. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/sap-netweaver-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)
	
6. On the **SAP NetWeaver Configuration** section, click **Configure SAP NetWeaver** to open **Configure sign-on** window. Copy the **SAML Entity ID** from the **Quick Reference section.**

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/sap-netweaver-tutorial/tutorial_sapnetweaver_configure.png) 

7. To configure single sign-on on **SAP NetWeaver** side, you need to send the downloaded **Metadata XML** and **SAML Entity ID** to [SAP NetWeaver support](https://www.sap.com/support.html). 

> [!TIP]
> You can now read a concise version of these instructions inside the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), while you are setting up the app!  After adding this app from the **Active Directory > Enterprise Applications** section, simply click the **Single Sign-On** tab and access the embedded documentation through the **Configuration** section at the bottom. You can read more about the embedded documentation feature here: [Azure AD embedded documentation]( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=845985)
