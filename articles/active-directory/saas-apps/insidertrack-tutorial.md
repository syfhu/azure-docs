# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Insider Track

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Insider Track with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Insider Track with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Insider Track.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Insider Track (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Insider Track, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- An Insider Track single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Insider Track from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Insider Track from the gallery
To configure the integration of Insider Track into Azure AD, you need to add Insider Track from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Insider Track from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **Insider Track**, select **Insider Track** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Insider Track based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Insider Track is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Insider Track needs to be established.

In Insider Track, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Insider Track, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Create an Insider Track test user](#create-an-insider-track-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Insider Track that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Insider Track application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Insider Track, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Insider Track** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/insidertrack-tutorial/tutorial_insidertrack_samlbase.png)

3. On the **Insider Track Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![Insider Track Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/insidertrack-tutorial/tutorial_insidertrack_url.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<companyname>/InsiderTrack.Portal.<companyname>/Sso/`

	> [!NOTE] 
	> Sign-on URL value is not real. Update this value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [Insider Track Client support team](https://cytecsolutions.com/contact/) to get this value.

4. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the metadata file on your computer.

5. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On Save button](./media/insidertrack-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)

6. On the **Insider Track Configuration** section, click **Configure Insider Track** to open **Configure sign-on** window. Copy the **Sign-Out URL, SAML Entity ID, and SAML Single Sign-On Service URL** from the **Quick Reference section.**

	![Insider Track Configuration](./media/insidertrack-tutorial/tutorial_insidertrack_configure.png) 

7. To configure single sign-on on **Insider Track** side, you need to send the downloaded **Metadata XML, Sign-Out URL, SAML Entity ID,** and **SAML Single Sign-On Service URL** to [Insider Track support team](https://cytecsolutions.com/contact/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

> [!TIP]
> You can now read a concise version of these instructions inside the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), while you are setting up the app!  After adding this app from the **Active Directory > Enterprise Applications** section, simply click the **Single Sign-On** tab and access the embedded documentation through the **Configuration** section at the bottom. You can read more about the embedded documentation feature here: [Azure AD embedded documentation]( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=845985)
