# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with G Suite

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate G Suite with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating G Suite with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to G Suite.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to G Suite (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with G Suite, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A G Suite single sign-on enabled subscription
- A Google Apps subscription or Google Cloud Platform subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Frequently Asked Questions
1.	**Q: Does this integration support Google Cloud Platform SSO integration with Azure AD?**
	
	A: Yes. Google Cloud Platform and Google Apps share the same authentication platform. So to do the GCP integration you need to configure the SSO with Google Apps.


2. **Q: Are Chromebooks and other Chrome devices compatible with Azure AD single sign-on?**
   
    A: Yes, users are able to sign into their Chromebook devices using their Azure AD credentials. See this [G Suite support article](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6060880) for information on why users may get prompted for credentials twice.

3. **Q: If I enable single sign-on, will users be able to use their Azure AD credentials to sign into any Google product, such as Google Classroom, GMail, Google Drive, YouTube, and so on?**
   
    A: Yes, depending on [which G Suite](https://support.google.com/a/answer/182442?hl=en&ref_topic=1227583) you choose to enable or disable for your organization.

4. **Q: Can I enable single sign-on for only a subset of my G Suite users?**
   
    A: No, turning on single sign-on immediately requires all your G Suite users to authenticate with their Azure AD credentials. Because G Suite doesn't support having multiple identity providers, the identity provider for your G Suite environment can either be Azure AD or Google -- but not both at the same time.

5. **Q: If a user is signed in through Windows, are they automatically authenticate to G Suite without getting prompted for a password?**
   
    A: There are two options for enabling this scenario. First, users could sign into Windows 10 devices via [Azure Active Directory Join](../device-management-introduction.md). Alternatively, users could sign into Windows devices that are domain-joined to an on-premises Active Directory that has been enabled for single sign-on to Azure AD via an [Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)](../connect/active-directory-aadconnect-user-signin.md) deployment. Both options require you to perform the steps in the following tutorial to enable single sign-on between Azure AD and G Suite.

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding G Suite from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding G Suite from the gallery
To configure the integration of G Suite into Azure AD, you need to add G Suite from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add G Suite from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **G Suite**, select **G Suite** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![G Suite in the results list](./media/google-apps-tutorial/tutorial_googleapps_addfromgallery.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with G Suite based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in G Suite is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in G Suite needs to be established.

In G Suite, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with G Suite, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Create a G Suite test user](#create-a-g-suite-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in G Suite that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your G Suite application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with G Suite, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **G Suite** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as **SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/google-apps-tutorial/tutorial_googleapps_samlbase.png)

3. On the **G Suite Domain and URLs** section, if you want to configure for the **Gmail** perform the following steps:

    ![G Suite Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/google-apps-tutorial/tutorial_googleapps_urlgmail.png)

### Create a G Suite test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called Britta Simon in G Suite Software. G Suite supports auto provisioning, which is by default enabled. There is no action for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in G Suite Software, a new one is created when you attempt to access G Suite Software.

>[!NOTE] 
>If you need to create a user manually, contact the [Google support team](https://www.google.com/contact/).

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to G Suite.

![Assign the user role][200] 

**To assign Britta Simon to G Suite, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, open the applications view, and then navigate to the directory view and go to **Enterprise applications** then click **All applications**.

	![Assign User][201] 

2. In the applications list, select **G Suite**.

    ![The G Suite link in the Applications list](./media/google-apps-tutorial/tutorial_googleapps_app.png)  

3. In the menu on the left, click **Users and groups**.

	![The "Users and groups" link][202]

4. Click **Add** button. Then select **Users and groups** on **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add Assignment pane][203]

5. On **Users and groups** dialog, select **Britta Simon** in the Users list.

6. Click **Select** button on **Users and groups** dialog.

7. Click **Assign** button on **Add Assignment** dialog.
	
### Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the G Suite tile in the Access Panel, you should get automatically signed-on to your G Suite application.
For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](../active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction.md).
