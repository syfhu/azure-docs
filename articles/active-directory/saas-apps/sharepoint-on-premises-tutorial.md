# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with SharePoint on-premises

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate SharePoint on-premises with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating SharePoint on-premises with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to SharePoint on-premises.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to SharePoint on-premises (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with SharePoint on-premises, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A SharePoint on-premises single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding SharePoint on-premises from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding SharePoint on-premises from the gallery
To configure the integration of SharePoint on-premises into Azure AD, you need to add SharePoint on-premises from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add SharePoint on-premises from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **SharePoint on-premises**, select **SharePoint on-premises** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![SharePoint on-premises in the results list](./media\sharepoint-on-premises-tutorial/tutorial_sharepointonpremises_addfromgallery.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SharePoint on-premises based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in SharePoint on-premises is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in SharePoint on-premises needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SharePoint on-premises, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Create a SharePoint on-premises test user](#create-a-sharePoint-on-premises-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in SharePoint on-premises that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your SharePoint on-premises application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with SharePoint on-premises, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **SharePoint on-premises** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.

	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media\sharepoint-on-premises-tutorial/tutorial_sharepointonpremises_samlbase.png)

3. On the **SharePoint on-premises Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![SharePoint on-premises Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media\sharepoint-on-premises-tutorial/tutorial_sharepointonpremises_url1.png)

	a. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<YourSharePointServerURL>/_trust/default.aspx`

    b. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `urn:sharepoint:<YourSharePointServerURL>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign-On URL and Identifier. Contact [SharePoint on-premises Client support team](https://support.office.com/) to get these values.

4. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the metadata file on your computer with the .cer extension. Copy and paste the full path of the downloaded metadata file into Notepad.

	![The Certificate download link](./media\sharepoint-on-premises-tutorial/tutorial_sharepointonpremises_certificate.png)

5. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On Save button](./media\sharepoint-on-premises-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)

6. On the **SharePoint on-premises Configuration** section, click **Configure SharePoint on-premises** to open **Configure sign-on** window. Copy the **Single Sign-On Service URL** from the **Quick Reference section.**

	![SharePoint on-premises Configuration](./media\sharepoint-on-premises-tutorial/tutorial_sharepointonpremises_configure.png)

	> [!NOTE]
	> Sharepoint On-Premises application uses SAML 1.1 token, so Azure AD expects WS Fed request from SharePoint server and after authentication, it issues the SAML 1.1. token.

7. In a different web browser window, log in to your SharePoint on-premises company site as an administrator.

8. **Configure a new trusted identity provider in SharePoint Server 2016**

	Sign into the SharePoint Server 2016 server and open the SharePoint 2016 Management Shell. Fill in the values of $realm, $wsfedurl, and $filepath from Azure portal and run the following commands to configure a new trusted identity provider.

	> [!TIP]
	> If you're new to using PowerShell or want to learn more about how PowerShell works, see [SharePoint PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sharepoint/overview?view=sharepoint-ps). 

	```
	$realm = "<Identifier value from the SharePoint on-premises Domain and URLs section in the Azure portal>"
	$wsfedurl="<SAML single sign-on service URL value which you have copied from the Azure portal>"
	$filepath="<Full path to SAML signing certificate file which you have copied from the Azure portal>"
	$cert = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2($filepath)
	New-SPTrustedRootAuthority -Name "AzureAD" -Certificate $cert
	$map = New-SPClaimTypeMapping -IncomingClaimType "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name" -IncomingClaimTypeDisplayName "name" -LocalClaimType "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn"
	$map2 = New-SPClaimTypeMapping -IncomingClaimType "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname" -IncomingClaimTypeDisplayName "GivenName" -SameAsIncoming
	$map3 = New-SPClaimTypeMapping -IncomingClaimType "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname" -IncomingClaimTypeDisplayName "SurName" -SameAsIncoming
	$map4 = New-SPClaimTypeMapping -IncomingClaimType "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress" -IncomingClaimTypeDisplayName "Email" -SameAsIncoming
	$ap = New-SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer -Name "AzureAD" -Description "SharePoint secured by Azure AD" -realm $realm -ImportTrustCertificate $cert -ClaimsMappings $map,$map2,$map3 -SignInUrl $wsfedurl -IdentifierClaim "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name"
	```

	Next, follow these steps to enable the trusted identity provider for your application:

	a. In Central Administration, navigate to **Manage Web Application** and select the web application that you wish to secure with Azure AD.

	b. In the ribbon, click **Authentication Providers** and choose the zone that you wish to use.

	c. Select **Trusted Identity provider** and select the identify provider you just registered named *AzureAD*.

	d. On the sign-in page URL setting, select **Custom sign in page** and provide the value “/_trust/”.

	e. Click **OK**.

### Create an Azure AD test user

The objective of this section is to create a test user in the Azure portal called Britta Simon.

   ![Create an Azure AD test user][100]

**To create a test user in Azure AD, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, in the left pane, click the **Azure Active Directory** button.

    ![The Azure Active Directory button](./media\sharepoint-on-premises-tutorial/create_aaduser_01.png)

2. To display the list of users, go to **Users and groups**, and then click **All users**.

    ![The "Users and groups" and "All users" links](./media\sharepoint-on-premises-tutorial/create_aaduser_02.png)

3. To open the **User** dialog box, click **Add** at the top of the **All Users** dialog box.

    ![The Add button](./media\sharepoint-on-premises-tutorial/create_aaduser_03.png)

4. In the **User** dialog box, perform the following steps:

    ![The User dialog box](./media\sharepoint-on-premises-tutorial/create_aaduser_04.png)

    a. In the **Name** box, type **BrittaSimon**.

    b. In the **User name** box, type the email address of user Britta Simon.

    c. Select the **Show Password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.

    d. Click **Create**.

### Create a SharePoint on-premises test user

1. In Central Administration, click **Application Management**.

2. On the **Application Management** page, in the **Web Applications** section, click **Manage web applications**.

3. Click the appropriate web application, and then click **User Policy**.

4. In Policy for Web Application, click **Add Users**.

	![Searching for a user by their name claim](./media\sharepoint-on-premises-tutorial/fig11-searchbynameclaim.png)

5. In the **Add Users** dialog box, click the appropriate zone in **Zones**, and then click **Next**.

6. In the **Policy for Web Application** dialog box, in the **Choose Users** section, click the **Browse** icon.

7. In the **Find** textbox, type the sign-in name for a user in your directory and click **Search**. </br>Example: *demouser@blueskyabove.onmicrosoft.com*.

8. Under the AzureAD heading in the list view, select the name property and click **Add** then click **OK** to close the dialog.

9. In Permissions, click **Full Control**.

	![Granting full control to a claims user](./media\sharepoint-on-premises-tutorial/fig12-grantfullcontrol.png)

10. Click **Finish**, and then click **OK**.

### Fixing People Picker

Users can now log into SharePoint 2016 using identities from Azure AD, but there are still opportunities for improvement to the user experience. For instance, searching for a user presents multiple search results in the people picker. There is a search result for each of the 3 claim types that were created in the claim mapping. To choose a user using the people picker, you must type their user name exactly and choose the **name** claim result.

![Claims search results](./media\sharepoint-on-premises-tutorial/fig16-claimssearchresults.png)

There is no validation on the values you search for, which can lead to misspellings or users accidentally choosing the wrong claim type to assign such as the **SurName** claim. This can prevent users from successfully accessing resources.

To assist with this scenario, there is an open-source solution called [AzureCP](https://yvand.github.io/AzureCP/) that provides a custom claims provider for SharePoint 2016. It will use the Azure AD Graph to resolve what users enter and perform validation. Learn more at [AzureCP](https://yvand.github.io/AzureCP/).

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to SharePoint on-premises.

![Assign the user role][200]

**To assign Britta Simon to SharePoint on-premises, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, open the applications view, and then navigate to the directory view and go to **Enterprise applications** then click **All applications**.

	![Assign User][201]

2. In the applications list, select **SharePoint on-premises**.

	![The SharePoint link in the Applications list](./media\sharepoint-on-premises-tutorial/tutorial_sharepointonpremises_app.png)

3. In the menu on the left, click **Users and groups**.

	![The "Users and groups" link][202]

4. Click **Add** button. Then select **Users and groups** on **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add Assignment pane][203]

5. On **Users and groups** dialog, select **Britta Simon** in the Users list.

6. Click **Select** button on **Users and groups** dialog.

7. Click **Assign** button on **Add Assignment** dialog.

### Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the SharePoint on-premises tile in the Access Panel, you should get automatically signed-on to your SharePoint on-premises application.
For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](../active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction.md).
