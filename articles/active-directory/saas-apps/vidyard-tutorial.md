# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Vidyard

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Vidyard with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Vidyard with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Vidyard.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Vidyard (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Vidyard, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Vidyard single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Vidyard from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Vidyard from the gallery
To configure the integration of Vidyard into Azure AD, you need to add Vidyard from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Vidyard from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **Vidyard**, select **Vidyard** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Vidyard in the results list](./media/vidyard-tutorial/tutorial_vidyard_addfromgallery.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Vidyard based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Vidyard is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Vidyard needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Vidyard, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Create a Vidyard test user](#create-a-vidyard-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Vidyard that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Vidyard application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Vidyard, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Vidyard** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/vidyard-tutorial/tutorial_vidyard_samlbase.png)

3. On the **Vidyard Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode:

	![Vidyard Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/vidyard-tutorial/tutorial_vidyard_url2.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://secure.vidyard.com/sso/saml/<unique id>/metadata`

	b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://secure.vidyard.com/sso/saml/<unique id>/consume`

4. Check **Show advanced URL settings** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

	![Vidyard Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/vidyard-tutorial/tutorial_vidyard_url1.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://secure.vidyard.com/sso/saml/<unique id>/login`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. You will update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL, and Sign-On URL, which is explained later in the tutorial

1. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Certificate(Base64)** and then save the certificate file on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](./media/vidyard-tutorial/tutorial_vidyard_certificate.png) 

6. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On Save button](./media/vidyard-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)

7. On the **Vidyard Configuration** section, click **Configure Vidyard** to open **Configure sign-on** window. Copy the **SAML Single Sign-On Service URL** from the **Quick Reference section.**

12. From the Single Sign On tab, select **Assign** next to an existing profile

	![Vidyard Configuration](./media/vidyard-tutorial/configure4.png)

	> [!NOTE]
	> Once you have created an SSO profile, assign it to any group(s) for which users will require access through Azure. If the user does not exist within the group to which they were assigned, Vidyard will automatically create a user account and assign their role in real-time.

13. Select your organization group, which is visible in the **Groups Available to Assign**.

	![Vidyard Configuration](./media/vidyard-tutorial/configure5.png)

14. You can see the assigned groups under the **Groups Currently Assigned**. Select a role for the group as per your organization and click **Confirm**.

>[!Note]
>If you need to create a user manually, contact [Vidyard support team](mailto:support@vidyard.com).

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Vidyard.
