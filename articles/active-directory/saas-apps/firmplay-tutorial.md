If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with FirmPlay - Employee Advocacy for Recruiting, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A FirmPlay - Employee Advocacy for Recruiting single-sign on enabled subscription


> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.


To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- You should not use your production environment, unless this is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get an one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).


## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding FirmPlay - Employee Advocacy for Recruiting from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on


## Adding FirmPlay - Employee Advocacy for Recruiting from the gallery

##  Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with FirmPlay - Employee Advocacy for Recruiting based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in FirmPlay - Employee Advocacy for Recruiting is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in FirmPlay - Employee Advocacy for Recruiting needs to be established.

This link relationship is established by assigning the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** in FirmPlay - Employee Advocacy for Recruiting.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with FirmPlay - Employee Advocacy for Recruiting, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a FirmPlay - Employee Advocacy for Recruiting test user](#creating-a-firmplay---employee-advocacy-for-recruiting-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in FirmPlay: Employee Advocacy for Recruiting that is linked to the Azure AD representation of her.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.
