# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with AwardSpring

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate AwardSpring with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating AwardSpring with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to AwardSpring.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to AwardSpring (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with AwardSpring, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- An AwardSpring single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding AwardSpring from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding AwardSpring from the gallery
To configure the integration of AwardSpring into Azure AD, you need to add AwardSpring from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add AwardSpring from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **AwardSpring**, select **AwardSpring** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![AwardSpring in the results list](./media/awardspring-tutorial/tutorial_awardspring_addfromgallery.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with AwardSpring based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in AwardSpring is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in AwardSpring needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with AwardSpring, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Create an AwardSpring test user](#create-an-awardspring-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in AwardSpring that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your AwardSpring application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with AwardSpring, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **AwardSpring** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/awardspring-tutorial/tutorial_awardspring_samlbase.png)

3. On the **AwardSpring Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode:

	![AwardSpring Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/awardspring-tutorial/tutorial_awardspring_url.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<subdomain>.awardspring.com/SignIn/SamlMetaData`

	b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<subdomain>.awardspring.com/SignIn/SamlAcs`

4. Check **Show advanced URL settings** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

	![AwardSpring Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/awardspring-tutorial/tutorial_awardspring_url1.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<subdomain>.awardspring.com/`
	 
	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL, and Sign-On URL. Contact [AwardSpring Client support team](mailto:support@awardspring.com) to get these values. 

5. AwardSpring application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format. Configure the following claims for this application. You can manage the values of these attributes from the **User Attributes** section on application integration page. The following screenshot shows an example for this.
	
	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/awardspring-tutorial/tutorial_awardSpring_attribute.png)

6. In the **User Attributes** section on the **Single sign-on** dialog, configure SAML token attribute as shown in the image above and perform the following steps:
    
	| Attribute Name | Attribute Value |
	| ---------------| --------------- |    
	| First Name | user.givenname |
	| Last Name | user.surname |
	| Email | user.mail |
	| Username | user.userprinicipalname |
	| StudentID | < Student ID > |

	> [!NOTE]
	> The StudentID attribute is mapped with the actual Student ID which needs to be passed back in claims. Contact [AwardSpring Client support team](mailto:support@awardspring.com) to get this value.

	a. Remove existing attributes and add new attributes. Click **Add attribute** to open the **Add Attribute** dialog.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/awardspring-tutorial/tutorial_attribute_04.png)

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/awardspring-tutorial/tutorial_attribute_05.png)
	
	b. In the **Name** textbox, type the attribute name shown for that row.
	
	c. From the **Value** list, type the attribute value shown for that row.

	d. Leave the **Namespace** blank.
	
	d. Click **Ok**

7. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the metadata file on your computer.
