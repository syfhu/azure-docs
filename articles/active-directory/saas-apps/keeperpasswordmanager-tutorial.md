# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault single-sign on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault from the gallery
To configure the integration of Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault into Azure AD, you need to add Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![Active Directory][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![Applications][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![Applications][3]

4. In the search box, type **Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault**.

##  Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault based on a test user called "Britta Simon."

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault needs to be established.

In Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault test user](#creating-a-keeperpasswordmanager-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure Single Sign-On][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/keeperpasswordmanager-tutorial/tutorial_keeper_samlbase.png)

3. On the **Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/keeperpasswordmanager-tutorial/tutorial_keeper_url.png)

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://{SSO CONNECT SERVER}/sso-connect/saml/login`

	b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://{SSO CONNECT SERVER}/sso-connect/saml/sso`

	c. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://{SSO CONNECT SERVER}/sso-connect`

	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Reply URL, and Sign-On URL. Contact [Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault Client support team](https://keepersecurity.com/contact.html) to get these values. 

4. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the metadata file on your computer.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/keeperpasswordmanager-tutorial/tutorial_keeper_certificate.png) 

5. Click **Save** button.
