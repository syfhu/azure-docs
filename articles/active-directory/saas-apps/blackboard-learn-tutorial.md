# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Blackboard Learn

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Blackboard Learn with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Blackboard Learn with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Blackboard Learn
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Blackboard Learn (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Blackboard Learn, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Blackboard Learn single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Blackboard Learn from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Blackboard Learn from the gallery
To configure the integration of Blackboard Learn into Azure AD, you need to add Blackboard Learn from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Blackboard Learn from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![Active Directory][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![Applications][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![Applications][3]

4. In the search box, type **Blackboard Learn**.

5. In the results panel, select **Blackboard Learn**, and then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Creating an Azure AD test user](./media/blackboard-learn-tutorial/tutorial_blackboardlearn_addfromgallery.png)

##  Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Blackboard Learn based on a test user called "Britta Simon."

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Blackboard Learn is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Blackboard Learn needs to be established.

This link relationship is established by assigning the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** in Blackboard Learn.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Blackboard Learn, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a Blackboard Learn test user](#creating-a-blackboard-learn-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Blackboard Learn that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Blackboard Learn application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Blackboard Learn, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Blackboard Learn** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure Single Sign-On][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/blackboard-learn-tutorial/tutorial_blackboardlearn_samlbase.png)

3. On the **Blackboard Learn Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/blackboard-learn-tutorial/tutorial_blackboardlearn_url.png)

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<subdomain>.blackboard.com/`

	b. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<subdomain>.blackboard.com/auth-saml/saml/SSO/entity-id/SAML_AD`
	
	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign-On URL and Identifier. Contact [Blackboard Learn Client support team](https://www.blackboard.com/support/index.aspx) to get these values. 

4. Blackboard Learn application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format. Configure the following claims for this application. You can manage the values of these attributes from the **User Attributes** section on application integration page.
 The following screenshot shows an example about it.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/blackboard-learn-tutorial/tutorial_attribute.png)

5. In the **User Attributes** section on **Single sign-on** dialog, configure SAML token attributes as shown in the image and perform the following steps. We have mapped the Userprincipalname as the unique user attribute here but you can map it to the appropriate value, which uniquely distinguishes the user in the organization and that maps to Blackboard Learn username field.
      	   
	| Attribute Name | Attribute Value |   
    | ---------------| ----------------|
	| urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.1.6 |user.userprincipalname |

	a. Click **Add attribute** to open the **Add Attribute** dialog.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/blackboard-learn-tutorial/tutorial_attribute_04.png)
	
	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/blackboard-learn-tutorial/tutorial_attribute_05.png)

	b. In the **Name** textbox, type the attribute name shown for that row.

	c. From the **Value** list, type the attribute value shown for that row.
	
	d. Click **Ok**.

4. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the XML file on your computer.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/blackboard-learn-tutorial/tutorial_blackboardlearn_certificate.png)

7. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/blackboard-learn-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)

8. On the **Blackboard Learn Configuration** section, click **Configure Blackboard Learn** to open **Configure sign-on** window. Copy the **SAML Entity ID** from the **Quick Reference section.**

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/blackboard-learn-tutorial/tutorial_blackboardlearn_configure.png) 

9. To configure single sign-on on **Blackboard Learn** side, you need to send the downloaded **Metadata XML** and **SAML Entity ID** to [Blackboard Learn support](https://www.blackboard.com/support/index.aspx).

> [!TIP]
> You can now read a concise version of these instructions inside the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), while you are setting up the app!  After adding this app from the **Active Directory > Enterprise Applications** section, simply click the **Single Sign-On** tab and access the embedded documentation through the **Configuration** section at the bottom. You can read more about the embedded documentation feature here: [Azure AD embedded documentation]( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=845985)
