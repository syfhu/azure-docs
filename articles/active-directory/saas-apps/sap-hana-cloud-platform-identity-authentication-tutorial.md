# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication is used as a proxy IdP to access SAP applications that use Azure AD as the main IdP.

When you integrate SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication with Azure AD, you get the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to the SAP applications.
- You can enable your users to automatically sign in to SAP applications with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location--the Azure portal.

For more information about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see the article [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription.
- A single sign-on-enabled subscription for SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication.

> [!NOTE]
> We don't recommend using a production environment to test the steps in this tutorial.

To test the steps in this tutorial, follow these recommendations:

- Don't use your production environment unless it's necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, [get a one-month free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario that's outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

Before you dive into the technical details, it's vital to understand the concepts you're going to look at. The SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication and Active Directory Federation Services enable you to implement SSO across applications or services that are protected by Azure AD (as an IdP) with SAP applications and services that are protected by SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication.

Currently, SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication acts as a Proxy Identity Provider to SAP applications. Azure Active Directory in turn acts as the leading Identity Provider in this setup. 

The following diagram illustrates this relationship:

![Creating an Azure AD test user](./media/sap-hana-cloud-platform-identity-authentication-tutorial/architecture-01.png)

With this setup, your SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication tenant is configured as a trusted application in Azure Active Directory. 

All SAP applications and services that you want to protect this way are subsequently configured in the SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication management console.

Therefore, the authorization for granting access to SAP applications and services needs to take place in SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication (as opposed to Azure Active Directory).

By configuring SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication as an application through the Azure Active Directory Marketplace, you don't need to configure individual claims or SAML assertions.

>[!NOTE] 
>Currently only Web SSO has been tested by both parties. The flows that are necessary for App-to-API or API-to-API communication should work but have not been tested yet. They will be tested during subsequent activities.
>

## Add SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication from the gallery
To configure the integration of SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication in Azure AD, you need to add SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication from the gallery, take the following steps:**

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), on the left navigation panel, select the **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Go to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add new the new application, select the **New application** button at the top of the dialog box.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication**. 

5. Select **SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication** from the results panel, and then select the **Add** button.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication. You configure and test it with a test user called "Britta Simon."

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know who the counterpart user in SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication is. In other words, you need to establish a link between an Azure AD user and the related user in SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication.

In SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication, give the value **Username** the same value as **user name** in Azure AD. Now you have established the link between the two users.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication, complete the following building blocks:

1. [Configure Azure AD single sign-on](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on) to enable your users to use this feature.
2. [Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user) to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. [Create an SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication test user](#create-an-sap-cloud-platform-identity-authentication-test-user) to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. [Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user) to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. [Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on) to verify that the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication, take the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. In the **Single sign-on** dialog box, under **SAML-based Sign-on**, select **Mode** to enable single sign-on.

### Create an SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication test user

You don't need to create a user in SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication. Users who are in the Azure AD user store can use the SSO functionality.

SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication supports the Identity Federation option. This option allows the application to check whether users who are authenticated by the corporate identity provider exist in the user store of SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication. 

The Identity Federation option is disabled by default. If Identity Federation is enabled, only the users that are imported in SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication can access the application. 

For more information about how to enable or disable Identity Federation with SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication, see "Enable Identity Federation with SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication" in [Configure Identity Federation with the User Store of SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/cloud_identity/frameset.htm?c029bbbaefbf4350af15115396ba14e2.html).

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication.

![Assign the user role][200] 

**To assign Britta Simon to SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication, take the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, open the applications view, and then go to the directory view. Next, go to **Enterprise applications**, and then select **All applications**.

	![Assign User][201]
