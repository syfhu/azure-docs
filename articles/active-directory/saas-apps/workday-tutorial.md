# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Workday

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Workday with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Workday with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Workday.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Workday (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Workday, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Workday single-sign on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Workday from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Workday from the gallery
To configure the integration of Workday into Azure AD, you need to add Workday from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Workday from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **Workday**, select **Workday** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Workday in the results list](./media/workday-tutorial/tutorial_workday_addfromgallery.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Workday based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Workday is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Workday needs to be established.

In Workday, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Workday, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Create a Workday test user](#create-a-workday-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Workday that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Workday application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Workday, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Workday** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/workday-tutorial/tutorial_workday_samlbase.png)

3. On the **Workday Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![Workday Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/workday-tutorial/tutorial_workday_url.png)

	a. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://impl.workday.com/<tenant>/login-saml2.htmld`

    b. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL: `http://www.workday.com`

4. Check **Show advanced URL settings** and perform the following step:

	![Workday Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/workday-tutorial/tutorial_workday_url1.png)

    In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://impl.workday.com/<tenant>/login-saml.htmld`
	 
	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not the real. Update these values with the actual Sign-on URL and Reply URL. Your reply URL must have a subdomain for example: www, wd2, wd3, wd3-impl, wd5, wd5-impl). 
    > Using something like "*http://www.myworkday.com*" works but "*http://myworkday.com*" does not. Contact [Workday Client support team](https://www.workday.com/en-us/partners-services/services/support.html) to get these values.  

5. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Certificate (Base64)** and then save the certificate file on your computer.
