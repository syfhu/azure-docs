# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal from the gallery
To configure the integration of Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal into Azure AD, you need to add Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal**, select **Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal needs to be established.

In Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Create a Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal test user](#create-a-palo-alto-networks---captive-portal-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/paloaltonetworks-captiveportal-tutorial/tutorial_paloaltocaptiveportal_samlbase.png)

3. On the **Palo Alto Networks - Captive Portal Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

### Test single sign-on

Captive Portal is configured behind the firewall on Windows VM.  To test single sign-on on Captive Portal, login on the Windows VM using RDP. From within the RDP session, open a browser to any web site, it should automatically open the SSO url and prompt for authentication. Once Authenticaiton is complete, you should be able to navgiate to web sites.
