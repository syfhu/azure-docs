# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Autotask Workplace

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Autotask Workplace with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Autotask Workplace with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Autotask Workplace
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Autotask Workplace (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Autotask Workplace, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- An Autotask Workplace single-sign on enabled subscription
- You must be an administrator or super administrator in Workplace.
- You must have an administrator account in the Azure AD.
- The users that will utilize this feature must have accounts within Workplace and the Azure AD, and their email addresses for both must match.

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Autotask Workplace from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Autotask Workplace from the gallery
To configure the integration of Autotask Workplace into Azure AD, you need to add Autotask Workplace from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Autotask Workplace from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **Autotask Workplace**, select  **Autotask Workplace**  from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Autotask Workplace in the results list](./media/autotaskworkplace-tutorial/tutorial_autotaskworkplace_addfromgallery.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Autotask Workplace based on a test user called "Britta Simon."

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Autotask Workplace is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Autotask Workplace needs to be established.

In Autotask Workplace, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Autotask Workplace, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Create an Autotask Workplace test user](#create-an-autotask-workplace-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Autotask Workplace that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Test Single Sign-On](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Autotask Workplace application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Autotask Workplace, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Autotask Workplace** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/autotaskworkplace-tutorial/tutorial_autotaskworkplace_samlbase.png)

3. If you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps on the **Autotask Workplace Domain and URLs** section:

	![Autotask workplace Domain and URLs single sign-on information for IDP](./media/autotaskworkplace-tutorial/tutorial_autotaskworkplace_url.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<subdomain>.awp.autotask.net/singlesignon/saml/metadata`

	b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<subdomain>.awp.autotask.net/singlesignon/saml/SSO`

4. If you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode, check **Show advanced URL settings** and perform the following steps:

	![Autotask workplace Domain and URLs single sign-on information for SP](./media/autotaskworkplace-tutorial/tutorial_autotaskworkplace_url1.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<subdomain>.awp.autotask.net/loginsso`
	 
	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL, and Sign-On URL. Contact [Autotask Workplace Client support team](https://awp.autotask.net/help/Content/0_HOME/Support_for_End_Clients.htm) to get these values. 

5. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the metadata file on your computer.

7. In a different web browser window, Log in to Workplace Online using the administrator credentials.

    >[!Note]
    >When configuring the IdP, a subdomain will need to be specified. To confirm the correct subdomain, login to Workplace Online. Once logged in, make note to the subdomain in the URL.
    >The subdomain is the part between the “https://“ and “.awp.autotask.net/“ and should be us, eu, ca, or au.

8. Go to **Configuration** > **Single Sign-On** and perform the following steps:

    ![Autotask Single Sign-on configuration](./media/autotaskworkplace-tutorial/tutorial_autotaskssoconfig1.png)
 
    a. Select the **XML Metadata File** option, and then upload the **Metadata XML** downloaded from Azure portal.

    b. Click **Enable SSO**.
