# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Skills Manager

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Skills Manager with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Skills Manager with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Skills Manager.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Skills Manager (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Skills Manager, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Skills Manager single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Skills Manager from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Skills Manager from the gallery
To configure the integration of Skills Manager into Azure AD, you need to add Skills Manager from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Skills Manager from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **Skills Manager**, select **Skills Manager** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Skills Manager based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Skills Manager is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Skills Manager needs to be established.

In Skills Manager, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Skills Manager, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Create a Skills Manager test user](#create-a-skills-manager-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Skills Manager that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Skills Manager application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Skills Manager, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Skills Manager** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/skillsmanager-tutorial/tutorial_skillsmanager_samlbase.png)

3. On the **Skills Manager Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![Skills Manager Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/skillsmanager-tutorial/tutorial_skillsmanager_url.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://subdomain.skills-manager.com/kennametal`

	b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://subdomain.skills-manager.com/public/SamlLogin2.aspx`

	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [Skills Manager support team](https://www.ibm.com/support/uk/?lnk=msu_uk) to get these values.
 
4. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Certificate(Base64)** and then save the certificate file on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](./media/skillsmanager-tutorial/tutorial_skillsmanager_certificate.png) 

5. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On Save button](./media/skillsmanager-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)

6. On the **Skills Manager Configuration** section, click **Configure Skills Manager** to open **Configure sign-on** window. Copy the **Sign-Out URL, SAML Entity ID, and SAML Single Sign-On Service URL** from the **Quick Reference section.**

	![Skills Manager Configuration](./media/skillsmanager-tutorial/tutorial_skillsmanager_configure.png) 

7. To configure single sign-on on **Skills Manager** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate(Base64)**, **Sign-Out URL, SAML Entity ID, and SAML Single Sign-On Service URL** to [Skills Manager support team](https://www.ibm.com/support/uk/?lnk=msu_uk). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

> [!TIP]
> You can now read a concise version of these instructions inside the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), while you are setting up the app!  After adding this app from the **Active Directory > Enterprise Applications** section, simply click the **Single Sign-On** tab and access the embedded documentation through the **Configuration** section at the bottom. You can read more about the embedded documentation feature here: [Azure AD embedded documentation]( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=845985)
