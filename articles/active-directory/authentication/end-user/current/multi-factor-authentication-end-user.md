# What does Azure Multi-Factor Authentication mean for me?
So, you have gotten an email from someone in IT or your boss saying that they have added additional security verification to your account.  So what does this mean?

Not to worry. Your organization simply wants to take extra steps to ensure that you are who you say you are when signing in. This verification is done by using a combination of your user name and password and a phone.  

So the first thing you need to do is complete the registration process.  But before we start that process there are a few things to decide.

* **Office phone or mobile phone** - Choose between using your office phone or your mobile phone.
* **Mobile phone call, text, or mobile app** - If using a mobile phone, choose between receiving a call, a text, or using the mobile app.
* **Mobile app with a notification or verification code** - If using the mobile app, choose between receiving a notification that you respond to or a verification code.

> [!NOTE]
> Your company support may disable one or more of these options.  If so, those options will not be available during the registration process.  

Now that you have decided on your verification method, it's time to register. Use the [Setup Experience](multi-factor-authentication-end-user-first-time.md) link to get started with a walk-through on the enrollment process.
