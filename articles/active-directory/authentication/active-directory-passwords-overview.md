# Azure AD self-service password reset for the IT professional

With Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) self-service password reset (SSPR), users can reset their passwords on their own when and where they need to. At the same time, administrators can control how a user's password gets reset. Users no longer need to call a help desk just to reset their password. Azure AD SSPR includes:

* **Self-service password change**: The user knows their password but wants to change it to something new.
* **Self-service password reset**: The user is unable to sign in and wants to reset their password by using one or more of the following validated authentication methods:
   * Send a text message to a validated mobile phone.
   * Make a phone call to a validated mobile or office phone.
   * Send an email to a validated secondary email account.
   * Answer their security questions.
* **Self-service account unlock**: The user is unable to sign in with their password and has been locked out. The user wants to unlock their account without administrator intervention by using their authentication methods.

## Why choose Azure AD SSPR

Azure AD SSPR helps you to:

* **Reduce costs** as help desk assisted password resets typically account for 20% of an IT organizationâ€™s support calls. 
* **Improve end-user experiences** and **reduce help desk volume** by giving end users the power to resolve their own password problems. There is no need to call a help desk or open a support request.
* **Drive mobility** as users can reset their passwords from wherever they are.
* **Maintain control** of the security policy. Administrators can continue to enforce the policies they have today.
