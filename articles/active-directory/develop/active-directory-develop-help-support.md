# Support and help options for developers 

Regardless if you are just starting to integrate with Azure Active Directory, Microsoft identities or Microsoft Graph API, or when you are implementing a new feature to your application, there are times that you need to obtain help from the community or understand the support options that you have as a developer. This article helps you to understand these options, below a summary:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Search to check if your problem question has not been answered by the community, or if an existing documentation for the feature you are trying to implement already exists
> * In some cases, you just want to use of our support tools to help you debug a specific your problem
> * If you can't find the answer from what you need, you may want to ask a question on *Stack Overflow*
> * If you find an issue with one of our authentication libraries, raise a *GitHub* issue
> * Finally, if you need to talk to someone, you might want to open a support request
