# Azure Active Directory authentication protocols
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) supports several of the most widely used authentication and authorization protocols. The topics in this section describe the supported protocols and their implementation in Azure AD. The topics included a review of supported claim types, an introduction to the use of federation metadata, detailed OAuth 2.0. and SAML 2.0 protocol reference documentation, and a troubleshooting section.
