# How to get AppSource Certified for Azure Active Directory
[Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) is a destination for business users to discover, try, and manage line-of-business SaaS applications (standalone SaaS and add-on to existing Microsoft SaaS products).

To list a standalone SaaS application on AppSource, your application must accept single sign-on from work accounts from any company or organization that has Azure Active Directory. The sign-in process must use the [OpenID Connect](./active-directory-protocols-openid-connect-code.md) or [OAuth 2.0](./active-directory-protocols-oauth-code.md) protocols. SAML integration is not accepted for AppSource certification.

## Guides and code samples
If you want to learn about how to integrate your application with Azure Active Directory using Open ID connect, follow our guides and code samples in the [Azure Active Directory developer's guide](./active-directory-developers-guide.md#get-started "Get Started with Azure AD for developers").

## Multi-tenant applications

An application that accepts sign-ins from users from any company or organization that have Azure Active Directory without requiring a separate instance, configuration, or deployment is known as a *multi-tenant application*. AppSource recommends that applications implement multi-tenancy to enable the *single-click* free trial experience.

In order to enable multi-tenancy on your application:
- Set `Multi-Tenanted` property to `Yes` on your application registration's information in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps) (by default, applications created in the Azure Portal are configured as *single-tenant*)
- Update your code to send requests to the '`common`' endpoint (update the endpoint from *https://login.microsoftonline.com/{yourtenant}* to *https://login.microsoftonline.com/common*)
- For some platforms, like ASP.NET, you need also to update your code to accept multiple issuers

For more information about multi-tenancy, see: [How to sign in any Azure Active Directory (AD) user using the multi-tenant application pattern](./active-directory-devhowto-multi-tenant-overview.md).

### Single-tenant applications
Applications that only accept sign-ins from users of a defined Azure Active Directory instance are known as *single-tenant application*. External users (including Work or School accounts from other organizations, or personal account) can sign in to a single-tenant application after adding each user as *guest account* to the Azure Active Directory instance that the application is registered. You can add users as guest accounts to an Azure Active Directory via the [*Azure AD B2B collaboration*](../b2b/what-is-b2b.md) - and it can be done [programatically](../b2b/code-samples.md). When you add a user as guest account to an Azure Active Directory, an invitation email is sent to the user, who has to accept the invitation by clicking on the link in the invitation email. Invitations that are sent to an additional user in an inviting organization that is also a member of the partner organization are not required to accept an invitation to sign in.

Single-tenant applications can enable the *Contact Me* experience, but if you want to enable the single-click/ free trial experience that AppSource recommends, enable multi-tenancy on your application instead.


## AppSource trial experiences

### Free Trial (Customer-led trial experience) 
The *customer-led trial* is the experience that AppSource recommends as it offers a single-click access to your application. Below an illustration of how this experience looks like:<br/><br/>

<table >
<tr>
    <td valign="top" width="33%">1.<br/><img src="media/active-directory-devhowto-appsource-certified/customer-led-trial-step1.png" width="85%"/><ul><li>User finds your application in AppSource Web Site</li><li>Selects ‘Free trial’ option</li></ul></td>
    <td valign="top" width="33%">2.<br/><img src="media/active-directory-devhowto-appsource-certified/customer-led-trial-step2.png" width="85%" /><ul><li>AppSource redirects user to a URL in your web site</li><li>Your web site starts the <i>single-sign-on</i> process automatically (on page load)</li></ul></td>
    <td valign="top" width="33%">3.<br/><img src="media/active-directory-devhowto-appsource-certified/customer-led-trial-step3.png" width="85%"/><ul><li>User is redirected to Microsoft Sign-in page</li><li>User provides credentials to sign in</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td valign="top" width="33%">4.<br/><img src="media/active-directory-devhowto-appsource-certified/customer-led-trial-step4.png" width="85%"/><ul><li>User gives consent for your application</li></ul></td>
    <td valign="top" width="33%">5.<br/><img src="media/active-directory-devhowto-appsource-certified/customer-led-trial-step5.png" width="85%"/><ul><li>Sign-in completes and user is redirected back to your web site</li><li>User starts the free trial</li></ul></td>
    <td></td>
</tr>
</table>

### Contact Me (Partner-led trial experience)
The *partner trial experience* can be used when a manual or a long-term operation needs to happen to provision the user/ company: for example, your application needs to provision virtual machines, database instances, or operations that take much time to complete. In this case, after user selects the *'Request Trial'* button and fills out a form, AppSource sends you the user's contact information. Upon receiving this information, you then provision the environment and send the instructions to the user on how to access the trial experience:<br/><br/>

        </tr>

        <ul><li>You receive user's information and setup trial instance</li><li>You send the hyperlink to access your application to the user</li></ul>
    </td>
