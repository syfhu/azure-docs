# Azure Active Directory code samples (V2 endpoint)

You can use Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to:

- Add authentication and authorization to your web applications and web APIs.
- Require an access token to access a protected web API.

This article briefly describes and provides you with links to samples for the Azure AD V2 endpoint. These samples show you how it's done, along with code snippets that you can use in your applications. On the code sample page, you'll find detailed readme topics that help with requirements, installation, and set up. Comments within the code are there to help you understand the critical sections.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are interested in V1 samples, see [Azure AD code samples (V1 endpoint)](active-directory-code-samples.md).

To understand the basic scenario for each sample type, see [App types for the Azure Active Directory v2.0 endpoint](active-directory-v2-flows.md).

You can also contribute to the samples on GitHub. To learn how, see [Microsoft Azure Active Directory samples and documentation](https://github.com/Azure-Samples?page=3&query=active-directory).

## Desktop and mobile public client apps

The following samples show public client applications (desktop/mobile applications) that access the Microsoft Graph or a Web API in the name of a user.

Client application | Platform | Flow/Grant | Calls Microsoft Graph | Calls an ASP.NET Core 2.0 Web API
------------------ | -------- | ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------------
Desktop (WPF)      | .NET/C#  | Interactive | [dotnet-desktop-msgraph-v2](http://github.com/azure-samples/active-directory-dotnet-desktop-msgraph-v2) <p/> [dotnet-admin-restricted-scopes-v2](https://github.com/azure-samples/active-directory-dotnet-admin-restricted-scopes-v2) | [dotnet-native-aspnetcore-v2](https://GitHub.com/azure-samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-aspnetcore-v2)
Mobile (UWP)   | .NET/C# (UWP) | Interactive | [dotnet-native-uwp-v2](https://github.com/azure-samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-uwp-v2) |
Mobile (Android, iOS, UWP)   | .NET/C# (Xamarin) | Interactive | [xamarin-native-v2](https://Github.com/azure-samples/active-directory-xamarin-native-v2) |
Mobile (iOS)       | iOS / Objective C or swift | Interactive | [ios-swift-native-v2](https://github.com/azure-samples/active-directory-ios-swift-native-v2) <p/> [ios-native-nxoauth2-v2](https://github.com/azure-samples/active-directory-ios-native-nxoauth2-v2) |
Mobile (Android)   | Android / Java | Interactive |   [android-native-v2](https://github.com/azure-samples/active-directory-android-native-v2 ) |

## Web applications

The following samples illustrate web applications that sign in users, call Microsoft Graph, or call a web API with the user's identity.

 Platform | Only signs in users | Signs in users and calls Microsoft Graph 
 -------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- 
ASP.NET 4.x | [appmodelv2-webapp-openIDConnect-dotNet](https://GitHub.com/AzureAdQuickstarts/AppModelv2-WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet) <p/> [dotnet-webapp-openidconnect-v2](https://GitHub.com/azure-samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapp-openidconnect-v2)  |              [aspnet-connect-rest-sample](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/aspnet-connect-rest-sample)   
ASP.NET Core 2.0 | [aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2) |              [aspnetcore-connect-sample](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/aspnetcore-connect-sample)   
Node.js      |                   | [AppModelv2-WebApp-OpenIDConnect-nodejs](https://github.com/azureadquickstarts/appmodelv2-webapp-openidconnect-nodejs)     
Ruby      |                   | [ruby-connect-rest-sample](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/ruby-connect-rest-sample)     

## Daemon applications

The following samples show desktop or web applications that access the Microsoft Graph or a web API with the application identity (no user).

Client application | Platform | Flow/Grant | Calls Microsoft Graph 
------------------ | -------- | ---------- | -------------------- 
Web app | .NET/C#  | Client Credentials | [dotnet-daemon-v2](https://github.com/azure-samples/active-directory-dotnet-daemon-v2) 

## Single page applications (SPA)

This sample shows how to write a single page application secured with Azure AD.

 Platform |  Calls Microsoft Graph 
 -------- |  --------------------- 
JavaScript (msal.js)  | [javascript-graphapi-v2](https://github.com/azure-samples/active-directory-javascript-graphapi-v2) 
JavaScript (msal.js + AngularJS) | [angular-connect-rest-sample](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/angular-connect-rest-sample) 
JavaScript (Hello.JS)  | [javascript-graphapi-web-v2](https://github.com/azure-samples/active-directory-javascript-graphapi-web-v2) 
JavaScript (hello.js + Angular 4) | [angular4-connect-sample](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/angular4-connect-sample) 

## Web APIs

### Web API protected by Azure AD

The following sample shows how to protect a web API with the Azure AD V2 endpoint.

Platform | Sample | Description
 -------- | ------------------- | ---------------------
Node.js | [dotnet-native-aspnetcore-v2](https://GitHub.com/azure-samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-aspnetcore-v2) | Calls an ASP.NET Core Web API from a WPF application using Azure AD V2.

### Web API calling Microsoft Graph or another Web API

This sample is not yet available.
