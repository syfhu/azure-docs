# Install Azure Backup Server v2

Azure Backup Server helps protect your virtual machines (VMs), workloads, files and folders, and more. Azure Backup Server v2 builds on Azure Backup Server v1, and gives you new features that are not available in v1. For a comparison of features between v1 and v2, see [Azure Backup Server protection matrix](backup-mabs-protection-matrix.md). 

The additional features in Backup Server v2 are an upgrade from Backup Server v1. However, Backup Server v1 is not a prerequisite for installing Backup Server v2. If you want to upgrade from Backup Server v1 to Backup Server v2, install Backup Server v2 on the Backup Server protection server. Your existing Backup Server settings remain intact.

You can install Backup Server v2 on Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016. To take advantage of new features like System Center 2016 Data Protection Manager Modern Backup Storage, you must install Backup Server v2 on Windows Server 2016. Before you upgrade to or install Backup Server v2, read about the [installation prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/system-center/dpm/install-dpm#setup-prerequisites).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Backup Server has the same code base as System Center Data Protection Manager. Backup Server v1 is equivalent to Data Protection Manager 2012 R2, and Backup Server v2 is equivalent to Data Protection Manager 2016. This article occasionally references the Data Protection Manager documentation.

## Upgrade Backup Server to v2
To upgrade from Backup Server v1 to Backup Server v2, make sure your installation has the required updates:

- [Update the protection agents](backup-mabs-upgrade-to-v2.md#update-the-data-protection-manager-protection-agent) on the protected servers.
- Upgrade Windows Server 2012 R2 to Windows Server 2016.
- Upgrade Azure Backup Server Remote Administrator on all production servers.
- Ensure that backups are set to continue without restarting your production server.


### Upgrade steps for Backup Server v2

## Add storage for Modern Backup Storage

To improve backup storage efficiency, Backup Server v2 adds support for volumes. Like Backup Server v1, Backup Server v2 supports disks.

### Add volumes and disks
If you run Backup Server v2 on Windows Server 2016, you can use volumes to store backup data. Volumes offer storage savings and faster backups. Because volumes are new to Backup Server, you must add them. 

When you add a volume to Backup Server, you can give the volume a friendly name. Click the **Friendly Name** column of the volume you want to name. You can change the name later, if necessary. You also can use PowerShell to add or change friendly names for volumes.

To add a volume in the Administrator Console:

1. In the Azure Backup Server Administrator Console, select **Management** > **Disk Storage** > **Add**.

    ![Open the Add Disk Storage wizard](./media//backup-mabs-upgrade-to-v2/open-add-disk-storage-wizard.png)

    This opens the Add Disk Storage wizard.

2. On the **Add Disk Storage** page, in the **Available volumes** box, select a volume, and then select **Add**.
3. In the **Selected volumes** box, enter a friendly name for the volume, and then select **OK**.

      ![Add Disk Storage wizard - Add volume](./media/backup-mabs-upgrade-to-v2/add-volume.png)

  If you want to add a disk, the disk must belong to a protection group that has legacy storage. These disks can only be used for these protection groups. If Backup Server doesn't have sources that have legacy protection, the disk isn't listed.

  For more information about adding disks, see [Adding disks to increase legacy storage](http://docs.microsoft.com/system-center/dpm/upgrade-to-dpm-2016#adding-disks-to-increase-legacy-storage). You can't give a disk a friendly name.


### Assign workloads to volumes

In Backup Server, you specify which workloads are assigned to which volumes. For example, you can set expensive volumes that support a high number of input/output operations per second (IOPS) to store only workloads that require frequent, high-volume backups. An example is SQL Server with transaction logs.

#### Update-DPMDiskStorage

To update the properties of a volume in the storage pool in Backup Server, use the PowerShell cmdlet Update-DPMDiskStorage.

Syntax:

`Parameter Set: Volume`

```
Update-DPMDiskStorage [-Volume] <Volume> [[-FriendlyName] <String> ] [[-DatasourceType] <VolumeTag[]> ] [-Confirm] [-WhatIf] [ <CommonParameters>]
```

All changes that you make by using PowerShell are reflected in the UI.


## Protect data sources
To begin protecting data sources, create a protection group. The following steps highlight changes or additions to the New Protection Group wizard.

To create a protection group:

1. In the Backup Server Administrator Console, select **Protection**.

2. On the tool ribbon, select **New**.

    This opens the Create New Protection Group wizard.

  ![Create New Protection Group wizard](./media/backup-mabs-upgrade-to-v2/create-a-protection-group-1.png)

3. On the **Welcome** page, select **Next**.
4. On the **Select Protection Group Type** page, select the type of protection group you want to create, and then select **Next**.

  ![Select Protection Group Type page](./media/backup-mabs-upgrade-to-v2/create-a-protection-group-2.png)

5. On the **Select Group Members** page, in the **Available members** pane, the members with protection agents are listed. For this example, select volume D:\ and E:\ and add them to the **Selected members** pane. Select **Next**.

  ![Select Group Members page](./media/backup-mabs-upgrade-to-v2/create-a-protection-group-3.png)

6. On the **Select Data Protection Method** page, enter a **Protection group name**, select the protection method, and then select **Next**. If you want short-term protection, you must select the **Disk** backup method.

  ![Select Data Protection Method page](./media/backup-mabs-upgrade-to-v2/create-a-protection-group-4.png)

7. On the **Specify Short-Term Goals** page, select the details for **Retention range** and **Synchronization frequency**. Then, select **Next**. Optionally, to change the schedule for when recovery points are taken, select **Modify**.

  ![Specify Short-Term Goals page](./media/backup-mabs-upgrade-to-v2/create-a-protection-group-5.png)

8. On the **Review Disk Storage Allocation** page, review details about the data sources you selected, their size, and  values for the space to be provisioned and the target storage volume.

  ![Review Disk Storage Allocation page](./media/backup-mabs-upgrade-to-v2/create-a-protection-group-6.png)

  Storage volumes are based on the workload volume allocation (set by using PowerShell) and the available storage. You can change the storage volumes by selecting other volumes in the drop-down menu. If you change the value for **Target Storage**, the value for **Available disk storage** dynamically changes to reflect values under **Free Space** and **Underprovisioned Space**.

  If the data sources grow as planned, the value for the **Underprovisioned Space** column in **Available disk storage** reflects the amount of additional storage that's needed. Use this value to help plan your storage needs for smooth backups. If the value is zero, there are no potential problems with storage in the foreseeable future. If the value is a number other than zero, you do not have sufficient storage allocated  (based on your protection policy and the data size of your protected members).

  ![Underallocated disk storage](./media/backup-mabs-upgrade-to-v2/create-a-protection-group-7.png)

   To finish creating your protection group, complete the wizard.

## Migrate legacy storage to Modern Backup Storage
After you upgrade to or install Backup Server v2 and upgrade the operating system to Windows Server 2016, update your protection groups to use Modern Backup Storage. By default, protection groups are not changed. They continue to function as they were initially set up. 

Updating protection groups to use Modern Backup Storage is optional. To update the protection group, stop protection of all data sources by using the retain data option. Then, add the data sources to a new protection group.

1. In the Administrator Console, select the **Protection** feature. In the **Protection Group Member** list, right-click the member, and then select **Stop protection of member**.

  ![Stop protection of member](http://docs.microsoft.com/system-center/dpm/media/upgrade-to-dpm-2016/dpm-2016-stop-protection1.png)

2. In the **Remove from Group** dialog box, review the used disk space and the available free space for the storage pool. The default is to leave the recovery points on the disk and allow them to expire per their associated retention policy. Click **OK**.

  If you want to immediately return the used disk space to the free storage pool, select the **Delete replica on disk** check box to delete the backup data (and recovery points) associated with that member.

  ![Remove from Group dialog box](http://docs.microsoft.com/system-center/dpm/media/upgrade-to-dpm-2016/dpm-2016-retain-data.png)

3. Create a protection group that uses Modern Backup Storage. Include the unprotected data sources.


## Add disks to increase legacy storage

If you want to use legacy storage with Backup Server, you might need to add disks to increase legacy storage. 

To add disk storage:

1. In the Administrator Console, select **Management** > **Disk Storage** > **Add**.

    ![Add Disk Storage dialog](http://docs.microsoft.com/system-center/dpm/media/upgrade-to-dpm-2016/dpm-2016-add-disk-storage.png)

4. In the **Add Disk Storage** dialog, select **Add disks**.

5. In the list of available disks, select the disks you want to add, select **Add**, and then select **OK**.

## Update the Data Protection Manager protection agent

Backup Server uses the System Center Data Protection Manager protection agent for updates. If you are upgrading a protection agent that is not connected to the network, you cannot use the Data Protection Manager Administrator Console to complete a connected agent upgrade. You must upgrade the protection agent in a nonactive domain environment. Until the client computer is connected to the network, the Data Protection Manager Administrator Console shows that the protection agent update is pending.

The following sections describe how to update protection agents for client computers that are connected and client computers that are not connected.

### Update a protection agent for a connected client computer

1. In the Backup Server Administrator Console, select **Management** > **Agents**.

2. In the display pane, select the client computers for which you want to update the protection agent.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The **Agent Updates** column indicates when a protection agent update is available for each protected computer. In the **Actions** pane, the **Update** action is available only when a protected computer is selected and updates are available.
  >
  >

3. To install updated protection agents on the selected computers, in the **Actions** pane, select **Update**.

### Update a protection agent on a client computer that is not connected

1. In the Backup Server Administrator Console, select **Management** > **Agents**.

2. In the display pane, select the client computers for which you want to update the protection agent.

  > [!NOTE]
   > The **Agent Updates** column indicates when a protection agent update is available for each protected computer. In the **Actions** pane, the **Update** action is not available when a protected computer is selected unless updates are available.
  >
  >

3. To install updated protection agents on the selected computers, select **Update**.

4. For a client computer that is not connected to the network, until the computer is connected to the network, the **Agent Status** column shows a status of **Update Pending**.

  After a client computer is connected to the network, the **Agent Updates** column for the client computer shows a status of **Updating**.
  
### Move legacy Protection groups from old version and sync the new version with Azure

Once Azure Backup Server and the OS are both updated, you are ready to protect new data sources using Modern Backup Storage. However already protected data sources will continue to be protected in the legacy way as they were in Azure Backup Server but all new protection will use Modern Backup Storage.

Below steps are to migrate data sources from legacy  mode of protection to Modern backup storage.

• Add the new volume(s) to the DPM storage pool and assign friendly names and data source tags if desired.
• For each data source that is in legacy mode, stop protection of the data sources and “Retain Protected Data”.  This will allow recovery of old recovery points after migration.

• Create a new PG and select the data sources that are to be stored using new format.
• DPM will do a replica copy from the legacy backup storage into the Modern Backup Storage volume locally.
  Note: This will be seen as a post-recovery operation job
• All new sync and recovery points will then be stored in Modern Backup Storage.
• Old recovery points will be pruned out as they expire and eventually free up the disk space.
• Once all the legacy volumes are deleted from the old storage, the disk can be removed from Azure backup and the system.
• Take a backup of the  Azure DPMDB.

Part 2:
-Important items> The new server will need to be named same as the original Azure Backup server. You cannot change the name of the new Azure backup server if you want to use old storage pool and DPMDB to retain recovery points
-Must have backup of DPMDB  as it will need to be restored

1) Shutdown the original Azure backup server or take it off the wire.
2) Reset the machine account in active directory.
3) Install Server 2016 on new machine and name it the same machine name as the original Azure Backup server.
4) Join the Domain
5) Install Azure Backup server V2 (Move DPM Storage pool disks from old server and import)
6) Restore the DPMDB taken from end of part 2
7) Attach the storage from the original backup server to the new server.
8) From SQL Restore the DPMDB
9) From admin command line on new server cd to Microsoft Azure Backup install location and bin folder

Path example:
C:\windows\system32>cd "c:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Backup\DPM\DPM\bin\
to Azure backup Run DPMSYNC -SYNC

10) Run DPMSYNC -SYNC
Note If you have added NEW disks to the DPM Storage pool instead of moving the old ones, then run DPMSYNC -Reallocatereplica

## New PowerShell cmdlets in v2

When you install Azure Backup Server v2, two new cmdlets are available: 
* [Mount-DPMRecoveryPoint](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt787159.aspx)
* [Dismount-DPMRecoveryPoint](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt787158.aspx)
