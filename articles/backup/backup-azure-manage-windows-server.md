# Monitor and manage Azure recovery services vaults and servers for Windows machines

This article contains an overview of the backup monitor and management tasks available through the Azure portal and the Microsoft Azure Backup agent. This article assumes you already have an Azure subscription and have created at least one Recovery Services vault.

[!INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-rm-include.md)]


## Open a Recovery Services vault

The Recovery Services vault dashboard shows you the details or attributes of a Recovery Services vault.

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) using your Azure subscription.
2. Click **All services**. 

3. You want to open a Recovery Services vault. In the dialog box, start typing **Recovery Services**. As you begin typing, the list filters based on your input. Click **Recovery Services vaults** to display the list of Recovery Services vaults in your subscription.

     ![Open list of Recovery Services vaults step 1](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/open-rs-vault-list.png) <br/>

    The list of Recovery Services vaults opens.

    ![Create Recovery Services Vault step 1](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/list-of-rs-vaults.png) <br/>

4. From the list of vaults, select the name of the Recovery Services vault you want to open. The Recovery Services vault dashboard menu opens.

    ![recovery services vault dashboard](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/rs-vault-blade.png) <br/>

    Now that you have opened the Recovery Services vault, try any of the monitoring or management tasks.

## Monitor backup jobs and alerts

You monitor jobs and alerts from the Recovery Services vault dashboard, where you see:

* Backup alerts details
* Files and folders, as well as Azure virtual machines protected in the cloud
* Total storage consumed in Azure
* Backup job status

![Backup dashboard tasks](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/dashboard-tiles.png)

Clicking the information in each of these tiles opens the associated menu where you manage related tasks.

From the top of the Dashboard:

* Settings - provides access available backup tasks.
* Backup - helps you back up new files and folders (or Azure VMs) to the Recovery Services vault.
* Delete - If a recovery services vault is no longer in use, delete it to free up storage space. Delete is only enabled after all protected servers have been deleted from the vault.

![Backup dashboard tasks](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/dashboard-tasks.png)

## Alerts for backups using Azure backup agent:
| Alert Level | Alerts sent |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | for Backup failure, recovery failure and deferred delete i.e., when someone stops protection with delete data |
| Warning | for Backup completed with warnings (when < 100 files are not backed up due to corruption issues, and > 1,000,000 files are successfully backed up) |
| Informational | currently, no informational alerts are available for Azure backup agent |

## Manage Backup alerts
Click the **Backup Alerts** tile to open the **Backup Alerts** menu and manage alerts.

![Backup alerts](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/manage-backup-alerts.png)

The Backup Alerts tile shows you the number of:

* critical alerts unresolved in last 24 hours
* warning alerts unresolved in last 24 hours

Click the link to view the **Backup Alerts** menu, with a filtered view of these alerts (critical or warning).

From the Backup Alerts menu, you:

* Choose the appropriate information to include with your alerts.

    ![Choose columns](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/choose-alerts-colunms.png)
* Filter alerts for severity, status, and start/end times.

    ![Filter alerts](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/filter-alerts.png)
* Configure notifications for severity, frequency and recipients, as well as turn alerts on or off.

    ![Filter alerts](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/configure-notifications.png)

If **Per Alert** is selected as the **Notify** frequency, no grouping or reduction in emails occurs. Every alert results in one notification (the default setting), and a resolution email is sent immediately.

If **Hourly Digest** is selected as the **Notify** frequency, an email is sent to the user explaining unresolved alerts were generated in the last hour. A resolution email is sent out at the end of the hour.

Alerts can be sent for the following severity levels:

* critical
* warning
* information

You inactivate the alert with the **inactivate** button in the job details menu. When you click inactivate, you can provide resolution notes.

You choose the columns you want to appear as part of the alert with the **Choose columns** button.

> [!NOTE]
> From the **Settings** menu, you manage backup alerts by selecting **Monitoring and Reports > Alerts and Events > Backup Alerts** and then clicking **Filter** or **Configure Notifications**.
>

## Manage Backup items
Managing on-premises backups is now available in the management portal. In the Backup section of the dashboard, the **Backup Items** tile shows the number of backup items protected to the vault.

Click **File-Folders** in the Backup Items tile.

![Backup items tile](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/backup-items-tile.png)

The Backup Items menu opens with the filter set to File-Folder where you see each specific backup item listed.

![Backup items](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/backup-item-list.png)

If you select a specific backup item from the list, you see the essential details for that item.

![Backup items from settings](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/backup-files-and-folders.png)

## Manage Backup jobs
Backup jobs for both on-premises (when the on-premises server is backing up to Azure) and Azure backups are visible in the dashboard.

In the Backup section of the dashboard, the Backup job tile shows the number of jobs:

* in progress
* failed in the last 24 hours.

To manage your backup jobs, click the **Backup Jobs** tile, which opens the Backup Jobs menu.

![Backup items from settings](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/backup-jobs.png)

You modify the information available in the Backup Jobs menu with the **Choose columns** button at the top of the page.

Use the **Filter** button to select between Files and folders and Azure virtual machine backup.

If you don't see your backup files and folders, click **Filter** button at the top of the page and select **Files and folders** from the Item Type menu.

> [!NOTE]
> From the **Settings** menu, you manage backup jobs by selecting **Monitoring and Reports > Jobs > Backup Jobs** and then selecting **File-Folders** from the drop down menu.

7. On the **Confirmation** screen review the information and click **Finish**.
8. Once the wizard finishes creating the **backup schedule**, click **Close**.

    After modifying protection, you can confirm that backups are triggering correctly by going to the **Jobs** tab and confirming that changes are reflected in the backup jobs.

## Enable Network Throttling

The Azure Backup agent provides a Throttling tab which allows you to control how network bandwidth is used during data transfer. This control can be helpful if you need to back up data during work hours but do not want the backup process to interfere with other internet traffic. Throttling of data transfer applies to back up and restore activities.  

To enable throttling:

1. In the **Backup agent**, click **Change Properties**.
2. On the **Throttling tab, select **Enable internet bandwidth usage throttling for backup operations**.

    ![Network throttling](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/throttling-dialog.png)

    Once you have enabled throttling, specify the allowed bandwidth for backup data transfer during **Work hours** and **Non-work hours**.

    The bandwidth values begin at 512 kilobytes per second (Kbps) and can go up to 1023 megabytes per second (Mbps). You can also designate the start and finish for **Work hours**, and which days of the week are considered Work days. The time outside of the designated Work hours is considered to be non-work hours.
3. Click **OK**.

## Manage exclusion settings
1. Open the **Microsoft Azure Backup agent** (you can find it by searching your machine for *Microsoft Azure Backup*).

    ![Schedule a Windows Server Backup](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/snap-in-search.png)
2. In the Microsoft Azure Backup agent click **Schedule Backup**.

    ![Schedule a Windows Server Backup](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/schedule-backup.png)
3. In the Schedule Backup Wizard leave the **Make changes to backup items or times** option selected and click **Next**.

    ![Schedule a Windows Server Backup](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/modify-or-stop-a-scheduled-backup.png)
4. Click **Exclusions Settings**.

    ![Schedule a Windows Server Backup](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/exclusion-settings.png)
5. Click **Add Exclusion**.

    ![Schedule a Windows Server Backup](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/add-exclusion.png)
6. Select the location and then, click **OK**.

    ![Schedule a Windows Server Backup](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/exclusion-location.png)
7. Add the file extension in the **File Type** field.

## Frequently asked questions
**Q1. The backup job status shows as completed in the Azure backup agent, why doesn't it get reflected immediately in portal?**

A1. There is at maximum delay of 15 mins between the backup job status reflected in the Azure backup agent and the Azure portal.

**Q.2 When a backup job fails, how long does it take to raise an alert?**

A.2 An alert is raised within 20 mins of the Azure backup failure.

**Q3. Is there a case where an email won’t be sent if notifications are configured?**

A3. Below are the cases when the notification will not be sent in order to reduce the alert noise:

* If notifications are configured hourly and an alert is raised and resolved within the hour
* Job is canceled.
* Second backup job failed because original backup job is in progress.

## Troubleshooting Monitoring Issues
**Issue:** Jobs and/or alerts from the Azure Backup agent do not appear in the portal.

**Troubleshooting steps:** The process, ```OBRecoveryServicesManagementAgent```, sends the job and alert data to the Azure Backup service. Occasionally this process can become stuck or shutdown.

1. To verify the process is not running, open **Task Manager** and check if the ```OBRecoveryServicesManagementAgent``` process is running.
2. Assuming that the process is not running, open **Control Panel** and browse the list of services. Start or restart **Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Management Agent**.

    For further information, browse the logs at:<br/>
   `<AzureBackup_agent_install_folder>\Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent\Temp\GatewayProvider*`
    For example:<br/>
   `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent\Temp\GatewayProvider0.errlog`
