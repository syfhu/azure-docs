# Customize web application firewall rules through PowerShell

The Azure Application Gateway web application firewall (WAF) provides protection for web applications. These protections are provided by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Core Rule Set (CRS). Some rules can cause false positives and block real traffic. For this reason, Application Gateway provides the capability to customize rule groups and rules. For more information on the specific rule groups and rules, see [List of web application firewall CRS Rule groups and rules](application-gateway-crs-rulegroups-rules.md).

## View rule groups and rules

The following code examples show how to view rules and rule groups that are configurable on a WAF-enabled application gateway.

### View rule groups

The following example shows how to view rule groups:

```powershell
Get-AzureRmApplicationGatewayAvailableWafRuleSets
```

The following output is a truncated response from the preceding example:

```
OWASP (Ver. 3.0):

    REQUEST-910-IP-REPUTATION:
        Description:
            
        Rules:
            RuleId     Description
            ------     -----------
            910011     Rule 910011
            910012     Rule 910012
            ...        ...

    REQUEST-911-METHOD-ENFORCEMENT:
        Description:
            
        Rules:
            RuleId     Description
            ------     -----------
            911011     Rule 911011
            ...        ...

OWASP (Ver. 2.2.9):

    crs_20_protocol_violations:
        Description:
            
        Rules:
            RuleId     Description
            ------     -----------
            960911     Invalid HTTP Request Line
            981227     Apache Error: Invalid URI in Request.
            960000     Attempted multipart/form-data bypass
            ...        ...
```

## Disable rules

The following example disables rules `910018` and `910017` on an application gateway:

```powershell
$disabledrules=New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayFirewallDisabledRuleGroupConfig -RuleGroupName REQUEST-910-IP-REPUTATION -Rules 910018,910017
Set-AzureRmApplicationGatewayWebApplicationFirewallConfiguration -ApplicationGateway $gw -Enabled $true -FirewallMode Detection -RuleSetVersion 3.0 -RuleSetType OWASP -DisabledRuleGroups $disabledrules
```

## Next steps

After you configure your disabled rules, you can learn how to view your WAF logs. For more information, see [Application Gateway Diagnostics](application-gateway-diagnostics.md#diagnostic-logging).
