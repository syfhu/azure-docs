# Restrict web traffic using the Azure CLI

This script creates an application gateway with a web application firewall that uses a virtual machine scale set for backend servers. The web application firewall restricts web traffic based on OWASP rules. After running the script, you can test the application gateway using its public IP address.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/application-gateway/create-vmss/create-vmss-waf.sh "Create application gateway")]

## Clean up deployment 

Run the following command to remove the resource group, application gateway, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive 
az group delete --name myResourceGroupAG --yes
```
