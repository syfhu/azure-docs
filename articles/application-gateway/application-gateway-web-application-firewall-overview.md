# Web application firewall (WAF)

Web application firewall (WAF) is a feature of Application Gateway that provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. 

Web application firewall is based on rules from the [OWASP core rule sets](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_ModSecurity_Core_Rule_Set_Project) 3.0 or 2.2.9. Web applications are increasingly targets of malicious attacks that exploit common known vulnerabilities. Common among these exploits are SQL injection attacks, cross site scripting attacks to name a few. Preventing such attacks in application code can be challenging and may require rigorous maintenance, patching and monitoring at multiple layers of the application topology. A centralized web application firewall helps make security management much simpler and gives better assurance to application administrators against threats or intrusions. A WAF solution can also react to a security threat faster by patching a known vulnerability at a central location versus securing each of individual web applications. Existing application gateways can be converted to a web application firewall enabled application gateway easily.

Application Gateway operates as an application delivery controller and offers SSL termination, cookie-based session affinity, round-robin load distribution, content-based routing, ability to host multiple websites and security enhancements. Security enhancements offered by Application Gateway include SSL policy management, end to end SSL support. Application security is now strengthened by WAF (web application firewall) being directly integrated into the ADC offering. This provides an easy to configure central location to manage and protect your web applications against common web vulnerabilities.

## Benefits

The following are the core benefits that Application Gateway and web application firewall provide:

### Protection

* Protect your web application from web vulnerabilities and attacks without modification to backend code.

* Protect multiple web applications at the same time behind an application gateway. Application gateway supports hosting up to 20 websites behind a single gateway that could all be protected against web attacks with WAF.

### Monitoring

* Monitor your web application against attacks using a real-time WAF log. This log is integrated with [Azure Monitor](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview.md) to track WAF alerts and logs and easily monitor trends.

* WAF integrates with Azure Security Center. Azure Security Center allows for a central view of the security state of all your Azure resources.

### Customization

* The ability to customize WAF rules and rule groups to suit your application requirements and eliminate false positives.

## Features

Web application firewall comes preconfigured with CRS 3.0 by default or you can choose to use 2.2.9. CRS 3.0 offers reduced false positives over 2.2.9. The ability to [customize rules to suit your needs](application-gateway-customize-waf-rules-portal.md) is provided. Some of the common web vulnerabilities which web application firewall protects against includes:

* SQL injection protection
* Cross site scripting protection
* Common Web Attacks Protection such as command injection, HTTP request smuggling, HTTP response splitting, and remote file inclusion attack
* Protection against HTTP protocol violations
* Protection against HTTP protocol anomalies such as missing host user-agent and accept headers
* Prevention against bots, crawlers, and scanners
* Detection of common application misconfigurations (for example, Apache, IIS, and so on.)

For a more detailed list of rules and their protections see the following [Core rule sets](#core-rule-sets).

### Core rule sets

Application Gateway supports two rule sets, CRS 3.0, and CRS 2.2.9. These core rules sets are collections of rules that protect your web applications for malicious activity.

#### OWASP_3.0

The 3.0 core rule set provided has 13 rule groups as shown in the following table. Each of these rule groups contains multiple rules, which can be disabled.

|**[crs_45_trojans](application-gateway-crs-rulegroups-rules.md#crs45)**|Contains rules to protect against backdoor Trojans.|

### WAF Modes

Application Gateway WAF can be configured to run in the following two modes:

* **Detection mode** – When configured to run in detection mode, Application Gateway WAF monitors and logs all threat alerts in to a log file. Logging diagnostics for Application Gateway should be turned on using the **Diagnostics** section. You also need to ensure that the WAF log is selected and turned on. When running in detection mode web application firewall does not block incoming requests.
* **Prevention mode** – When configured to run in prevention mode, Application Gateway actively blocks intrusions and attacks detected by its rules. The attacker receives a 403 unauthorized access exception and the connection is terminated. Prevention mode continues to log such attacks in the WAF logs.

### <a name="application-gateway-waf-reports"></a>WAF Monitoring

Monitoring the health of your application gateway is important. Monitoring the health of your web application firewall and the applications that it protects are provided through logging and integration with Azure Monitor, Azure Security Center, and Log Analytics.

![diagnostics](./media/application-gateway-web-application-firewall-overview/diagnostics.png)

#### Azure Monitor

Each application gateway log is integrated with [Azure Monitor](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview.md).  This allows you to track diagnostic information including WAF alerts and logs.  This capability is provided within the Application Gateway resource in the portal under the **Diagnostics** tab or through the Azure Monitor service directly. To learn more about enabling diagnostic logs for application gateway visit [Application Gateway diagnostics](application-gateway-diagnostics.md)

#### Azure Security Center

[Azure Security Center](../security-center/security-center-intro.md) helps you prevent, detect, and respond to threats with increased visibility into and control over the security of your Azure resources. Application gateway [integrates into Azure Security Center](application-gateway-integration-security-center.md). Azure Security Center scans your environment to detect unprotected web applications. It can now recommend application gateway WAF to protect these vulnerable resources. You can directly create application gateway WAF from the Azure Security Center.  These WAF instances are integrated with Azure Security Center and will send alerts and health information back to Azure Security Center for reporting.

![figure 1](./media/application-gateway-web-application-firewall-overview/figure1.png)

#### Logging

Application Gateway WAF provides detailed reporting on each threat it detects. Logging is integrated with Azure Diagnostics logs and alerts are recorded in a json format. These logs can be integrated with [Log Analytics](../log-analytics/log-analytics-azure-networking-analytics.md).

## Application Gateway WAF SKU pricing

Web application firewall is available under a new a WAF SKU. This SKU is available only in Azure Resource Manager provisioning model and not under the classic deployment model. Additionally WAF SKU comes only in medium and large application gateway instance sizes. All the limits for application gateway also apply to the WAF SKU. Pricing is based on per hour gateway instance charge and data processing charge. Per hour gateway pricing for WAF SKU is different from Standard SKU charges and can be found at [Application Gateway pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/application-gateway/). Data processing charges remain the same. There is no per rule or rule group charges. You can protect multiple web applications behind the same web application firewall and there are no additional charges for supporting multiple applications.
