# Tutorial: Monitor your IoT devices

In this tutorial, you use the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator to monitor your connected IoT devices. You use the solution dashboard to view telemetry, device information, alerts, and KPIs.

To introduce these monitoring features, the tutorial uses two simulated truck devices. The trucks are managed by an organization called Contoso and are connected to the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator. As a Contoso operator, you need to monitor the location and behavior of your trucks in the field.

In this tutorial, you:

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need a deployed instance of the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator in your Azure subscription.

If you haven't deployed the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator yet, you should complete the [Deploy a cloud-based remote monitoring solution](quickstart-remote-monitoring-deploy.md) quickstart.

## Choose the devices to display

To select which connected devices display on the **Dashboard** page, use filters. To display only the **Truck** devices, choose the built-in **Trucks** filter in the filter drop-down:

[![Filter for trucks on the dashboard](./media/iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-monitor/dashboardtruckfilter-inline.png)](./media/iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-monitor/dashboardtruckfilter-expanded.png#lightbox)

When you apply a filter, only those devices that match the filter conditions are displayed on the map on the **Dashboard** page:

[![Only trucks are displayed on the map](./media/iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-monitor/dashboardtruckmap-inline.png)](./media/iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-monitor/dashboardtruckmap-expanded.png#lightbox)

The filter also determines which devices you see in the **Telemetry** chart:

[![Truck telemetry is displayed on the dashboard](./media/iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-monitor/dashboardtelemetry-inline.png)](./media/iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-monitor/dashboardtelemetry-expanded.png#lightbox)

To create, edit, and delete filters, choose **Manage device groups**.

## View real-time telemetry

The solution accelerator plots real-time telemetry in the chart on the **Dashboard** page. The top of the telemetry chart shows available telemetry types for the devices selected by the current filter:

[![Truck telemetry types](./media/iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-monitor/dashboardtelemetryview-inline.png)](./media/iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-monitor/dashboardtelemetryview-expanded.png#lightbox)

To view temperature telemetry, click **Temperature**:

## Use the map

The map displays information about the simulated trucks selected by the current filter. You can zoom and pan the map to display locations in more or less detail. The color of a device icon on the map indicates whether any **Alerts** or **Warnings** are active for the device. A summary of the number of **Alerts** and **Warnings** is displayed to the left of the map.

To view the device details, pan and zoom the map to locate the device, then select the device on the map. Then click on the device label to open the **Device details** panel. Device details include:

* Recent telemetry values
* Methods the device supports
* Device properties

## View alerts

The **Alerts** panel displays detailed information about the most recent alerts from your devices:

[![View device alerts on the dashboard](./media/iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-monitor/dashboardsystemalarms-inline.png)](./media/iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-monitor/dashboardsystemalarms-expanded.png#lightbox)

You can use a filter to adjust the time span for recent alerts. By default, the panel displays alerts from the last hour:

[![Filter the alerts by time](./media/iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-monitor/dashboardalarmsfilter-inline.png)](./media/iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-monitor/dashboardalarmsfilter-expanded.png#lightbox)

## View the system KPIs

The **Dashboard** page displays system KPIs calculated by the solution accelerator in the **Analytics** panel:

[![Dashboard KPIs](./media/iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-monitor/dashboardkpis-inline.png)](./media/iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-monitor/dashboardkpis-expanded.png#lightbox)

The dashboard shows three KPIs for the alerts selected by the current device and timespan filters:

* The number of active alerts for the rules that have triggered the most alerts.
* The proportion of alerts by device type.
* The percentage of alerts that are critical alerts.

The same filters that set the time span for alerts and control which devices are displayed determine how the KPIs are aggregated. By default, the panel displays KPIs aggregated over the last hour.

## Clean up resources

If you plan to move on to the next tutorial, leave the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator deployed. To reduce the costs of running the solution accelerator while you're not using it, you can stop the simulated devices in the settings panel:

[![Pause telemetry](./media/iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-monitor/togglesimulation-inline.png)](./media/iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-monitor/togglesimulation-expanded.png#lightbox)

You can restart the simulated devices when you're ready to start the next tutorial.

If you no longer need the solution accelerator, delete it from the [Provisioned solutions](https://www.azureiotsolutions.com/Accelerators#dashboard) page:

## Next steps

This tutorial showed you how to use the **Dashboard** page in the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator to filter and monitor the simulated trucks. To learn how to use the solution accelerator to detect issues with your connected devices, continue to the next tutorial.
