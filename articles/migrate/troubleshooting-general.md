# Troubleshoot Azure Migrate

## Troubleshoot common errors

[Azure Migrate](migrate-overview.md) assesses on-premises workloads for migration to Azure. Use this article to troubleshoot issues when deploying and using Azure Migrate.

### Migration project creation failed with error *Requests must contain user identity headers*

This issue can happen for users who do not have access to the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant of the organization. When a user is added to an Azure AD tenant for the first time, he/she receives an email invite to join the tenant. Users need to go to the email and accept the invitation to get successfully added to the tenant. If you are unable to see the email, reach out to a user who already has access to the tenant and ask them to resend the invitation to you using the steps specified [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/add-users-administrator#resend-invitations-to-guest-users).

Once the invitation email is received, you need to open the email and click the link in the email to accept the invitation. Once this is done, you need to sign out of Azure portal and sign-in again, refreshing the browser will not work. You can then try creating the migration project.

### Performance data for disks and networks adapters shows as zeros

This can occur if the statistics setting level on the vCenter server is set to less than three. At level three or higher, vCenter stores VM performance history for compute, storage, and network. For less than level three, vCenter doesn't store storage and network data, but CPU and memory data only. In this scenario, performance data shows as zero in Azure Migrate, and Azure Migrate provides size recommendation for disks and networks based on the metadata collected from the on-premises machines.

To enable collection of disk and network performance data, change the statistics settings level to three. Then, wait at least a day to discover your environment and assess it.

### I installed agents and used the dependency visualization to create groups. Now post failover, the machines show "Install agent" action instead of "View dependencies"
* Post planned or unplanned failover, on-premises machines are turned off and equivalent machines are spun up in Azure. These machines acquire a different MAC address. They may acquire a different IP address based on whether the user chose to retain on-premises IP address or not. If both MAC and IP addresses differ, Azure Migrate does not associate the on-premises machines with any Service Map dependency data and asks user to install agents instead of viewing dependencies.
* Post test failover, the on-premises machines remain turned on as expected. Equivalent machines spun up in Azure acquire different MAC address and may acquire different IP address. Unless the user blocks outgoing Log Analytics traffic from these machines, Azure Migrate does not associate the on-premises machines with any Service Map dependency data and asks user to install agents instead of viewing dependencies.

## Collector errors

### Deployment of collector OVA failed

This could happen if the OVA is partially downloaded or due to the browser if you are using vSphere web client to deploy the OVA. Ensure that the download is complete and try deploying the OVA with a different browser.

### Collector is not able to connect to the internet

This can happen when the machine you are using is behind a proxy. Make sure you provide the authorization credentials if the proxy needs one.
If you are using any URL-based firewall proxy to control outbound connectivity, be sure to whitelist these required URLs:

**URL** | **Purpose**  
--- | ---
*.portal.azure.com | Required to check connectivity with the Azure service and validate time synchronization issues.
*.oneget.org | Required to download the powershell based vCenter PowerCLI module.

**The collector can't connect to the project using the project ID and key I copied from the portal.**

Make sure you've copied and pasted the right information. To troubleshoot, install the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) and verify if the MMA can connect to the project as follows:

1. On the collector VM, download the [MMA](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=828603).
2. To start the installation, double-click the downloaded file.
3. In setup, on the **Welcome** page, click **Next**. On the **License Terms** page, click **I Agree** to accept the license.
4. In **Destination Folder**, keep or modify the default installation folder > **Next**.
5. In **Agent Setup Options**, select **Azure Log Analytics** > **Next**.
6. Click **Add** to add a new Log Analytics workspace. Paste in project ID and key that you copied. Then click **Next**.
7. Verify that the agent can connect to the project. If it can't, verify the settings. If the agent can connect but the collector can't, contact Support.


### Error 802: Date and time synchronization error

The server clock might be out-of-synchronization with the current time by more than five minutes. Change the clock time on the collector VM to match the current time, as follows:

1. Open an admin command prompt on the VM.
2. To check the time zone, run w32tm /tz.
3. To synchronize the time, run w32tm /resync.

### VMware PowerCLI installation failed

Azure Migrate collector downloads PowerCLI and installs it on the appliance. Failure in PowerCLI installation could be due to unreachable endpoints for the PowerCLI repository. To troubleshoot, try manually installing PowerCLI in the collector VM using the following step:

1. Open Windows PowerShell in administrator mode
2. Go to the directory C:\ProgramFiles\ProfilerService\VMWare\Scripts\
3. Run the script InstallPowerCLI.ps1

### Error UnhandledException Internal error occured: System.IO.FileNotFoundException

This is an issue seen on Collector versions less than 1.0.9.5. If you are on a Collector version 1.0.9.2 or pre-GA versions like 1.0.8.59, you will face this issue. Follow the [link given here to the forums for a detailed answer](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/c1f59456-7ba1-45e7-9d96-bae18112fb52/azure-migrate-connect-to-vcenter-server-error?forum=AzureMigrate).

[Upgrade your Collector to fix the issue](https://aka.ms/migrate/col/checkforupdates).

### Error UnableToConnectToServer

Unable to connect to vCenter Server "Servername.com:9443" due to error: There was no endpoint listening at https://Servername.com:9443/sdk that could accept the message.

Check if you are running the latest version of the collector appliance, if not, upgrade the appliance to the [latest version](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/concepts-collector#how-to-upgrade-collector).

If the issue still happens in the latest version, it could be because the collector machine is unable to resolve the vCenter Server name specified or the port specified is wrong. By default, if the port is not specified, collector will try to connect to the port number 443.

1. Try to ping the Servername.com from the collector machine.
2. If step 1 fails, try to connect to the vCenter server over IP address.
3. Identify the correct port number to connect to the vCenter.
4. Finally check if the vCenter server is up and running.

## Troubleshoot readiness issues

**Issue** | **Fix**
--- | ---
Unsupported boot type | Azure does not support VMs with EFI boot type. It is recommended to convert the boot type to BIOS before you run a migration. <br/><br/>You can use [Azure Site Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/tutorial-migrate-on-premises-to-azure) to do the migration of such VMs as it will convert the boot type of the VM to BIOS during the migration.
Conditionally supported Windows OS | The OS has passed its end of support date and needs a Custom Support Agreement (CSA) for [support in Azure](https://aka.ms/WSosstatement), consider upgrading the OS before migrating to Azure.
Unsupported Windows OS | Azure supports only [selected Windows OS versions](https://aka.ms/WSosstatement), consider upgrading the OS of the machine before migrating to Azure.
Conditionally endorsed Linux OS | Azure endorses only [selected Linux OS versions](../virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros.md), consider upgrading the OS of the machine before migrating to Azure.
Unendorsed Linux OS | The machine may boot in Azure, but no OS support is provided by Azure, consider upgrading the OS to an [endorsed Linux version](../virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros.md) before migrating to Azure
Unknown operating system | The operating system of the VM was specified as 'Other' in vCenter Server, due to which Azure Migrate cannot identify the Azure readiness of the VM. Ensure that the OS running inside the machine is [supported](https://aka.ms/azureoslist) by Azure before you migrate the machine.
Unsupported OS bitness | VMs with 32-bit OS may boot in Azure, but it is recommended to upgrade the OS of the VM from 32-bit to 64-bit before migrating to Azure.
Requires Visual Studio subscription. | The machines has a Windows client OS running inside it which is supported only in Visual Studio subscription.
VM not found for the required storage performance. | The storage performance (IOPS/throughput) required for the machine exceeds Azure VM support. Reduce storage requirements for the machine before migration.
VM not found for the required network performance. | The network performance (in/out) required for the machine exceeds Azure VM support. Reduce the networking requirements for the machine.
VM not found in specified pricing tier. | If the pricing tier is set to Standard, consider downsizing the VM before migrating to Azure. If the sizing tier is Basic, consider changing the pricing tier of the assessment to Standard.
VM not found in the specified location. | Use a different target location before migration.
One or more unsuitable disks. | One or more disks attached to the VM do not meet the Azure requirements. For each disk attached to the VM, ensure that the size of the disk is < 4 TB, if not, shrink the disk size before migrating to Azure. Ensure that the performance (IOPS/throughput) needed by each disk is supported by Azure [managed virtual machine disks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits#storage-limits).   
One or more unsuitable network adapters. | Remove unused network adapters from the machine before migration.
Disk count exceeds limit | Remove unused disks from the machine before migration.
Disk size exceeds limit | Azure supports disks with up to size 4 TB. Shrink disks to less than 4 TB before migration.
Disk unavailable in the specified location | Make sure the disk is in your target location before you migrate.
Disk unavailable for the specified redundancy | The disk should use the redundancy storage type defined in the assessment settings (LRS by default).
Could not determine disk suitability due to an internal error | Try creating a new assessment for the group.
VM with required cores and memory not found | Azure couldn't fine a suitable VM type. Reduce the memory and number of cores of the on-premises machine before you migrate.
Could not determine VM suitability due to an internal error. | Try creating a new assessment for the group.
Could not determine suitability for one or more disks due to an internal error. | Try creating a new assessment for the group.
Could not determine suitability for one or more network adapters due to an internal error. | Try creating a new assessment for the group.


## Collect logs

**How do I collect logs on the collector VM?**

Logging is enabled by default. Logs are located as follows:

- C:\Profiler\ProfilerEngineDB.sqlite
- C:\Profiler\Service.log
- C:\Profiler\WebApp.log

To collect Event Tracing for Windows, do the following:

1. On the collector VM, open a PowerShell command window.
2. Run **Get-EventLog -LogName Application | export-csv eventlog.csv**.

**How do I collect portal network traffic logs?**

1. Open the browser and navigate and log in [to the portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Press F12 to start the Developer Tools. If needed, clear the setting **Clear entries on navigation**.
3. Click the **Network** tab, and start capturing network traffic:
 - In Chrome, select **Preserve log**. The recording should start automatically. A red circle indicates that traffic is being capture. If it doesn't appear, click the black circle to start
 - In Edge/IE, recording should start automatically. If it doesn't, click the green play button.
4. Try to reproduce the error.
5. After you've encountered the error while recording, stop recording, and save a copy of the recorded activity:
 - In Chrome, right-click and click **Save as HAR with content**. This zips and exports the logs as a .har file.
 - In Edge/IE, click the **Export captured traffic** icon. This zips and exports the log.
6. Navigate to the **Console** tab to check for any warnings or errors. To save the console log:
 - In Chrome, right-click anywhere in the console log. Select **Save as**, to export and zip the log.
 - In Edge/IE, right-click on the errors and select **Copy all**.
7. Close Developer Tools.
