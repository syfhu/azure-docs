# Bind a custom SSL certificate to a web app

This sample script creates a web app in App Service with its related resources, then binds the SSL certificate of a custom domain name to it. 

If needed, install the Azure PowerShell using the instruction found in the [Azure PowerShell guide](/powershell/azure/overview), and then run `Connect-AzureRmAccount` to create a connection with Azure. Also, ensure that:

- A connection with Azure has been created using the `az login` command.
- You have access to your domain registrar's DNS configuration page.
- You have a valid .PFX file and its password for the SSL certificate you want to upload and bind.

## Sample script

[!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/app-service/configure-ssl-certificate/configure-ssl-certificate.ps1?highlight=1-3 "Bind a custom SSL certificate to a web app")]

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group, web app, and all related resources.

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Force
```

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.
