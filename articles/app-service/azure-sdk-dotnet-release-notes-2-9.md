# Azure SDK for .NET 2.9 release notes

This topic includes release notes for versions 2.9 and 2.9.6 of Azure SDK for .NET.

## Azure SDK for .NET 2.9.6 release summary

Release date: 11/16/2016
 
No breaking changes to the Azure SDK 2.9 have been introduced in this release. There is also no upgrade process needed to leverage this SDK with existing Cloud Service projects.

### Visual Studio 2017 Release Candidate

- In Visual Studio 2017 RC, this release of the Azure SDK for .NET is built in in the Azure Workload. All the tools you need to do Azure development will be part of Visual Studio 2017 RC going forward. For Visual Studio 2015 and Visual Studio 2013, the SDK will still be available through WebPI. We will be discontinuing Azure SDK for .NET releases for Visual Studio 2013, when Visual Studio 2017 releases as a final product. Follow this link to download Visual Studio 2017 RC: https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-2017-rc/

### Azure Diagnostics

- Changed the behavior to only store a partial connection string with the key replaced by a token for Cloud Services diagnostics storage connection string. The actual storage key is now stored in the user profile folder so its access can be controlled. Visual Studio will read the storage key from user profile folder for local debugging and publishing process. 
- In response to the change described above, Visual Studio Online team enhanced the Azure Cloud Services deployment task template so users could specify the storage key for setting diagnostics extension when publishing to Azure in Continuous Integration and Deployment.
- We’ve made it possible to store secure connection string and tokenization for Azure Diagnostics (WAD), to help you solve problems with configuration across environements.
 
### Windows Server 2016 virtual machines

- Visual Studio now supports deploying Cloud Services to OS Family 5 (Windows Server 2016) virtual machines. For existing cloud services, you can change your settings to target the new OS Family. When creating new cloud services, if you choose to create the service using .net 4.6 or higher, it will default the service to use OS Family 5.  For more information, you can review the [Guest OS Family support table](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-guestos-update-matrix/).

#### Known issues

- Azure .NET SDK 2.9.6 introduced a restriction that blocks deployment of projects using unsupported .NET frameworks (such as .NET 4.6) to any OS Family < 5. A workaround is provided [here](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-cloud-services-files/tree/master/Azure%20Targets%20SDK%202.9).

 
### Azure In-Role Cache 

- Support for Azure In-Role Cache ends on November 30, 2016. For more details, click [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-managed-cache-and-in-role-cache-services-to-be-retired-on-11-30-2016/).

### Azure Resource Manager Templates for Azure Stack

- We’ve introduced Azure Stack as a deployment target for your Azure Resource Manager Templates.
