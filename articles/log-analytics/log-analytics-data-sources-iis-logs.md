# IIS logs in Log Analytics
Internet Information Services (IIS) stores user activity in log files that can be collected by Log Analytics.  

![IIS logs](media/log-analytics-data-sources-iis-logs/overview.png)

## Configuring IIS logs
Log Analytics collects entries from log files created by IIS, so you must [configure IIS for logging](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831775.aspx).

Log Analytics only supports IIS log files stored in W3C format and does not support custom fields or IIS Advanced Logging.  
Log Analytics does not collect logs in NCSA or IIS native format.

Configure IIS logs in Log Analytics from the [Data menu in Log Analytics Settings](log-analytics-data-sources.md#configuring-data-sources).  There is no configuration required other than selecting **Collect W3C format IIS log files**.


## Data collection
Log Analytics collects IIS log entries from each agent each time the log is closed and a new one is created. This frequency is controlled by the **Log File Rollover Schedule** setting for the IIS site which is once a day by default. For example, if the settings is **Hourly**, then Log Analytics will collect the log each hour.  If the setting is **Daily**, then Log Analytics will collect the log every 24 hours.


## IIS log record properties
IIS log records have a type of **W3CIISLog** and have the properties in the following table:

| Property | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| Computer |Name of the computer that the event was collected from. |
| cIP |IP address of the client. |
| csMethod |Method of the request such as GET or POST. |
| csReferer |Site that the user followed a link from to the current site. |
| csUserAgent |Browser type of the client. |
| csUserName |Name of the authenticated user that accessed the server. Anonymous users are indicated by a hyphen. |
| csUriStem |Target of the request such as a web page. |
| csUriQuery |Query, if any, that the client was trying to perform. |
| ManagementGroupName |Name of the management group for Operations Manager agents.  For other agents, this is AOI-\<workspace ID\> |
| RemoteIPCountry |Country of the IP address of the client. |
| RemoteIPLatitude |Latitude of the client IP address. |
| RemoteIPLongitude |Longitude of the client IP address. |
| scStatus |HTTP status code. |
| scSubStatus |Substatus error code. |
| scWin32Status |Windows status code. |
| sIP |IP address of the web server. |
| SourceSystem |OpsMgr |
| sPort |Port on the server the client connected to. |
| sSiteName |Name of the IIS site. |
| TimeGenerated |Date and time the entry was logged. |
| TimeTaken |Length of time to process the request in milliseconds. |

## Log searches with IIS logs
The following table provides different examples of log queries that retrieve IIS log records.

| Query | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| W3CIISLog |All IIS log records. |
| W3CIISLog &#124; where scStatus==500 |All IIS log records with a return status of 500. |
| W3CIISLog &#124; summarize count() by cIP |Count of IIS log entries by client IP address. |
| W3CIISLog &#124; where csHost=="www.contoso.com" &#124; summarize count() by csUriStem |Count of IIS log entries by URL for the host www.contoso.com. |
| W3CIISLog &#124; summarize sum(csBytes) by Computer &#124; take 500000 |Total bytes received by each IIS computer. |

## Next steps
* Configure Log Analytics to collect other [data sources](log-analytics-data-sources.md) for analysis.
* Learn about [log searches](log-analytics-log-searches.md) to analyze the data collected from data sources and solutions.
* Configure alerts in Log Analytics to proactively notify you of important conditions found in IIS logs.
