# Create a Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal
In the Azure Portal you can set up a Log Analytics workspace, which is a unique Log Analytics environment with its own data repository, data sources, and solutions.  The steps described in this article are required if you intend on collecting data from the following sources:

* Azure resources in your subscription
* On-premises computers monitored by System Center Operations Manager
* Device collections from System Center Configuration Manager 
* Diagnostic or log data from Azure storage

For other sources, such as Azure VMs and Windows or Linux computers in your environment, see the following topics:

*  [Collect data about Azure Virtual Machines](log-analytics-quick-collect-azurevm.md) 
*  [Collect data about Linux computers](log-analytics-quick-collect-linux-computer.md)
*  [Collect data about Windows computers](log-analytics-quick-collect-windows-computer.md)

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Log in to Azure portal
Log in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com). 

## Create a workspace
1. In the Azure portal, click **All services**. In the list of resources, type **Log Analytics**. As you begin typing, the list filters based on your input. Select **Log Analytics**.<br><br> ![Azure portal](media/log-analytics-quick-collect-azurevm/azure-portal-01.png)<br><br>  
2. Click **Create**, and then select choices for the following items:

  * Provide a name for the new **OMS Workspace**, such as *DefaultLAWorkspace*. 
  * Select a **Subscription** to link to by selecting from the drop-down list if the default selected is not appropriate.
  * For **Resource Group**, chose to use an existing resource group already setup or create a new one.  
  * Select an available **Location**.  For additional information, see which [regions Log Analytics is available in](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/).
  * If you are creating a workspace in a new subscription created after April 2, 2018, it will automatically use the *Per GB* pricing plan and the option to select a pricing tier will not be available.  If you are creating a workspace for an existing subscription created before April 2, or to subscription that was tied to an existing EA enrollment, select your preferred pricing tier.  For additional information about the particular tiers, see [Log Analytics Pricing Details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/log-analytics/).

3. After providing the required information on the **OMS Workspace** pane, click **OK**.  

While the information is verified and the workspace is created, you can track its progress under **Notifications** from the menu. 

## Next steps
Now that you have a workspace available, you can configure collection of monitoring telemetry, run log searches to analyze that data, and add a management solution to provide additional data and analytic insights. 

* To enable data collection from Azure resources with Azure Diagnostics or Azure storage, see [Collect Azure service logs and metrics for use in Log Analytics](log-analytics-azure-storage.md).  
* [Add System Center Operations Manager as a data source](log-analytics-om-agents.md) to collect data from agents reporting your Operations Manager management group and store it in your Log Analytics workspace repository. 
* Connect [Configuration Manager](log-analytics-sccm.md) to import computers that are members of collections in the hierarchy.  
* Review the [management solutions](/log-analytics-add-solutions.md) available and how to add or remove a solution from your workspace.
