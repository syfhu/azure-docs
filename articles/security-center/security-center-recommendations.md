# Managing security recommendations in Azure Security Center
This document walks you through how to use recommendations in Azure Security Center to help you protect your Azure resources.

> [!NOTE]
> This document introduces the service by using an example deployment.  This document is not a step-by-step guide.
>
>

## What are security recommendations?
Security Center periodically analyzes the security state of your Azure resources. When Security Center identifies potential security vulnerabilities, it creates recommendations. The recommendations guide you through the process of configuring the needed controls.

## Implementing security recommendations
### Set recommendations
In [Setting security policies in Azure Security Center](security-center-policies.md), you learn to:

* Configure security policies.
* Turn on data collection.
* Choose which recommendations to see as part of your security policy.

Current policy recommendations center around system updates, baseline rules, anti-malware programs, [network security groups](../virtual-network/security-overview.md) on subnets and network interfaces, SQL database auditing, SQL database transparent data encryption, and web application firewalls.  [Setting security policies](security-center-policies.md) provides a description of each recommendation option.

### Monitor recommendations
After setting a security policy, Security Center analyzes the security state of your resources to identify potential vulnerabilities. The **Recommendations** tile under **Overview** lets you know the total number of recommendations identified by Security Center.

![Recommendations tile][1]

To see the details of each recommendation, select the **Recommendations tile** under **Overview**. **Recommendations** opens.

![Filter recommendations][2]

The recommendations are shown in a table format where each line represents one particular recommendation. The columns of this table are:

* **DESCRIPTION**: Explains the recommendation and what needs to be done to address it.
* **RESOURCE**: Lists the resources to which this recommendation applies.
* **STATE**: Describes the current state of the recommendation:
  * **Open**: The recommendation hasn't been addressed yet.
  * **In Progress**: The recommendation is currently being applied to the resources, and no action is required by you.
  * **Resolved**: The recommendation has already been completed (in this case, the line is grayed out).
* **SEVERITY**: Describes the severity of that particular recommendation:
  * **High**: A vulnerability exists with a meaningful resource (such as an application, a VM, or a network security group) and requires attention.
  * **Medium**: A vulnerability exists and non-critical or additional steps are required to eliminate it or to complete a process.
  * **Low**: A vulnerability exists that should be addressed but does not require immediate attention. (By default, low recommendations aren't presented, but you can filter on low recommendations if you want to see them.)

Use the table below as a reference to help you understand the available recommendations and what each one does if you apply it.

> [!NOTE]
> You will want to understand the [classic and Resource Manager deployment models](../azure-classic-rm.md) for Azure resources.

| Recommendation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Enable data collection for subscriptions](security-center-enable-data-collection.md) |Recommends that you turn on data collection in the security policy for each of your subscriptions and all Azure virtual machines (VMs) and non-Azure computers. |
| [Remediate security configurations](security-center-remediate-os-vulnerabilities.md) |Recommends that you align your OS configurations with the recommended security configuration rules, for example, do not allow passwords to be saved. |
| [Apply system updates](security-center-apply-system-updates.md) |Recommends that you deploy missing system security and critical updates to your Windows and Linux VMs and computers. |
| [Apply a Just-In-Time network access control](security-center-just-in-time.md) | Recommends that you apply just in time VM access. The just in time feature is in preview and available on the Standard tier of Security Center. See [Pricing](security-center-pricing.md) to learn more about Security Center's pricing tiers. |
| [Reboot after system updates](security-center-apply-system-updates.md#reboot-after-system-updates) |Recommends that you reboot a VM to complete the process of applying system updates. |
| [Add a web application firewall](security-center-add-web-application-firewall.md) |Recommends that you deploy a web application firewall (WAF) for web endpoints. A WAF recommendation is shown for any public facing IP (either Instance Level IP or Load Balanced IP) that has an associated network security group with open inbound web ports (80,443). </br>Security Center recommends that you provision a WAF to help defend against attacks targeting your web applications on virtual machines and on App Service Environment. An App Service Environment (ASE) is a [Premium](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/) service plan option of Azure App Service that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for securely running Azure App Service apps. To learn more about ASE, see the [App Service Environment Documentation](../app-service/environment/intro.md).</br>You can protect multiple web applications in Security Center by adding these applications to your existing WAF deployments. |
| [Finalize application protection](security-center-add-web-application-firewall.md#finalize-application-protection) |To complete the configuration of a WAF, traffic must be rerouted to the WAF appliance. Following this recommendation completes the necessary setup changes. |
| [Add a Next Generation Firewall](security-center-add-next-generation-firewall.md) |Recommends that you add a Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) from a Microsoft partner to increase your security protections. |
| [Route traffic through NGFW only](security-center-add-next-generation-firewall.md#route-traffic-through-ngfw-only) |Recommends that you configure network security group (NSG) rules that force inbound traffic to your VM through your NGFW. |
| [Install Endpoint Protection](security-center-install-endpoint-protection.md) |Recommends that you provision antimalware programs to VMs (Windows VMs only). |
| [Enable Network Security Groups on subnets or virtual machines](security-center-enable-network-security-groups.md) |Recommends that you enable NSGs on subnets or VMs. |
| [Restrict access through Internet facing endpoint](security-center-restrict-access-through-internet-facing-endpoints.md) |Recommends that you configure inbound traffic rules for NSGs. |
| [Enable auditing and threat detection on SQL servers](security-center-enable-auditing-on-sql-servers.md) |Recommends that you turn on auditing and threat detection for Azure SQL servers. (Azure SQL service only. Doesn't include SQL running on your virtual machines.) |
| [Enable auditing and threat detection on SQL databases](security-center-enable-auditing-on-sql-databases.md) |Recommends that you turn on auditing and threat detection for Azure SQL databases. (Azure SQL service only. Doesn't include SQL running on your virtual machines.) |
| [Enable Transparent Data Encryption on SQL databases](security-center-enable-transparent-data-encryption.md) |Recommends that you enable encryption for SQL databases. (Azure SQL service only.) |
| [Enable VM Agent](security-center-enable-vm-agent.md) |Enables you to see which VMs require the VM Agent. The VM Agent must be installed on VMs to provision patch scanning, baseline scanning, and antimalware programs. The VM Agent is installed by default for VMs that are deployed from the Azure Marketplace. The article [VM Agent and Extensions â€“ Part 2](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/04/15/vm-agent-and-extensions-part-2/) provides information on how to install the VM Agent. |
| [Apply disk encryption](security-center-apply-disk-encryption.md) |Recommends that you encrypt your VM disks using Azure Disk Encryption (Windows and Linux VMs). Encryption is recommended for both the OS and data volumes on your VM. |
| [Provide security contact details](security-center-provide-security-contact-details.md) |Recommends that you provide security contact information for each of your subscriptions. Contact information is an email address and phone number. The information is used to contact you if our security team finds that your resources are compromised. |
| [Update OS version](security-center-update-os-version.md) |Recommends that you update the operating system (OS) version for your Cloud Service to the most recent version available for your OS family.  To learn more about Cloud Services, see the [Cloud Services overview](../cloud-services/cloud-services-choose-me.md). |
| [Vulnerability assessment not installed](security-center-vulnerability-assessment-recommendations.md) |Recommends that you install a vulnerability assessment solution on your VM. |
| [Remediate vulnerabilities](security-center-vulnerability-assessment-recommendations.md#review-the-recommendation) |Enables you to see system and application vulnerabilities detected by the vulnerability assessment solution installed on your VM. |
| [Enable encryption for Azure Storage Account](security-center-enable-encryption-for-storage-account.md) | Recommends that you enable Azure Storage Service Encryption for data at rest. Storage Service Encryption (SSE) works by encrypting the data when it is written to Azure storage and decrypts before retrieval. SSE is currently available only for the Azure Blob service and can be used for block blobs, page blobs, and append blobs. To learn more, see [Storage Service Encryption for data at rest](../storage/common/storage-service-encryption.md).</br>SSE is only supported on Resource Manager storage accounts. |
| App Service should only be accessible over HTTPS | Recommends that you limit access of App Service over HTTPS only. |
| Web Sockets should be disabled for Web Application| Recommends that you carefully review the use of Web Sockets within web applications.  The Web Sockets protocol is vulnerable to different types of security threats. |
| Use custom domains for your Web Application | Recommends that you use custom domains to protect a web application from common attacks such as phishing and other DNS-related attacks. |
| Configure IP restrictions for Web Application | Recommends that you define a list of IP addresses that are allowed to access your application.  Use of IP restrictions protects a web application from common attacks. |
| Do not allow all ('*') resources to access your application | Recommends that you do not set WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES parameter to â€˜*â€™. Setting the parameter to â€˜*â€™ means that all certificates will be loaded to your web applications personal certificate store.  This can lead to abuse of the principle of least privilege as it is unlikely that the site needs access to all certificates at runtime. |
| CORS should not allow every resource to access your application | Recommends that you allow only required domains to interact with your web application. Cross origin resource sharing (CORS) should not allow all domains to access your web application. |
| Use the latest supported .NET Framework for Web Application | Recommends that you use the latest .NET Framework version for the latest security classes. Using older classes and types can make your application vulnerable. |
| Use the latest supported Java version for Web Application | Recommends that you use the latest Java version for the latest security classes. Using older classes and types can make your application vulnerable. |
| Use the latest supported PHP version for Web Application | Recommends that you use the latest PHP version for the latest security classes. Using older classes and types can make your application vulnerable. |
| [Add a web application firewall](security-center-add-web-application-firewall.md) |Recommends that you deploy a web application firewall (WAF) for web endpoints. A WAF recommendation is shown for any public facing IP (either Instance Level IP or Load Balanced IP) that has an associated network security group with open inbound web ports (80,443).</br></br>Security Center recommends that you provision a WAF to help defend against attacks targeting your web applications on virtual machines and on App Service Environment. An App Service Environment (ASE) is a [Premium](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/) service plan option of Azure App Service that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for securely running Azure App Service apps. To learn more about ASE, see the [App Service Environment Documentation](../app-service/environment/intro.md).</br></br>You can protect multiple web applications in Security Center by adding these applications to your existing WAF deployments. |
| [Finalize application protection](security-center-add-web-application-firewall.md#finalize-application-protection) |To complete the configuration of a WAF, traffic must be rerouted to the WAF appliance. Following this recommendation completes the necessary setup changes. |
| Use the latest supported Node.js version for Web Application | Recommends that you use the latest Node.js version for the latest security classes. Using older classes and types can make your application vulnerable. |
| CORS should not allow every resource to access your Function App | Recommends that you allow only required domains to interact with your web application. Cross origin resource sharing (CORS) should not allow all domains to access your function application. |
| Use custom domains for Function App | Recommends that you use custom domains to protect a function app from common attacks such as phishing and other DNS-related attacks. |
| Configure IP restrictions for Function App | Recommends that you define a list of IP addresses that are allowed to access your application. Use of IP restrictions protects a function app from common attacks. |
| Function App should only be accessible over HTTPS | Recommends that you limit access of Function apps over HTTPS only. |
| Remote debugging should be turned off for Function App | Recommends that you turn off debugging for Function App if you no longer need to use it. Remote debugging requires inbound ports to be opened on a Function App. |
| Web Sockets should be disabled for Function App | Recommends that you carefully review the use of Web Sockets within Function Apps. The Web Sockets protocol is vulnerable to different types of security threats. |
| Designate more than one owner on your subscription | Recommends that you designate more than one subscription owner in order to have administrator access redundancy. |
| Designate up to 3 owners on your subscription | Recommends that you designate less than 3 subscription owners in order to reduce the potential for breach by a compromised owner. |
| Enable MFA for accounts with owner permissions on your subscription | Recommends that you enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all subscription accounts with administrator privileges to prevent a breach of accounts or resources. |
| Enable MFA for accounts with write permissions on your subscription | Recommends that you enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all subscription accounts with write privileges to prevent a breach of accounts or resources. |
| Enable MFA for accounts with read permissions on your subscription | Recommends that you enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all subscription accounts with read privileges to prevent a breach of accounts or resources. |
| Remove external accounts with read permissions from your subscription | Recommends that you remove external accounts with read privileges from your subscription in order to prevent unmonitored access. |
| Remove external accounts with write permissions from your subscription | Recommends that you remove external accounts with write privileges from your subscription in order to prevent unmonitored access. |
| Remove external accounts with owner permissions from your subscription | Recommends that you remove external accounts with owner permissions from your subscription in order to prevent unmonitored access. |
| Remove deprecated accounts from subscription | Recommends that you remove deprecated accounts from your subscriptions. |
| Remove deprecated accounts with owner permissions from subscription | Recommends that you remove deprecated accounts with owner permissions from your subscriptions. |
You can filter and dismiss recommendations.

1. Select **Filter** on the **Recommendations** blade. The **Filter** blade opens and you select the severity and state values you wish to see.

2. If you determine that a recommendation is not applicable, you can dismiss the recommendation and then filter it out of your view. There are two ways to dismiss a recommendation. One way is to right click an item, and then select **Dismiss**. The other is to hover over an item, click the three dots that appear to the right, and then select **Dismiss**. You can view dismissed recommendations by clicking **Filter**, and then selecting **Dismissed**.

    ![Dismiss recommendation][3]

### Apply recommendations
After reviewing all recommendations, decide which one you should apply first. We recommend that you use the severity rating as the main parameter to evaluate which recommendations should be applied first.

In the table of recommendations above, select a recommendation and walk through it as an example of how to apply a recommendation.
