# Connecting Microsoft Azure Application Gateway to Azure Security Center
This document helps you to configure the integration with Application Gateway web application firewall (WAF) and Security Center.

## Why connect Application Gateway?
The WAF in Application Gateway protects web applications from common web-based attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting attacks, and session hijacks. Security Center integrates with Application Gateway to prevent and detect threats to unprotected web applications in your environment.

## How do I configure this integration?
Security Center discovers previously deployed WAF instances in the subscription. Connect these solutions to Security Center to allow integration of alerts.

> [!NOTE]
> The Application Gateway WAF can also be provisioned from Security Center's **Recommendations** as described in [Add a web application firewall](security-center-add-web-application-firewall.md).

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/azure-portal/).
