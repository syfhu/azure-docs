# Run Ansible with Bash in Azure Cloud Shell

In this tutorial, you learn how to perform various Ansible tasks from Bash in Cloud Shell. These tasks include connecting to a virtual machine, and creating Ansible playbooks to create and delete an Azure resource group.

## Prerequisites

- **Azure subscription** - If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

- **Azure credentials** - [Create Azure credentials and configure Ansible](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/ansible-install-configure#create-azure-credentials)

- **Configure Azure Cloud Shell** - If you are new to Azure Cloud Shell, the article [Quickstart for Bash in Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart) illustrates how to start and configure Cloud Shell. Launch a dedicated website for Cloud Shell here:

## Use Ansible to connect to a VM
Ansible has created a Python script called [azure_rm.py](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/contrib/inventory/azure_rm.py) that generates a dynamic inventory of your Azure resources by making API requests to the Azure Resource Manager. The following steps walk you through using the `azure_rm.py` script to connect to an Azure virtual machine:

1. Open Bash in Cloud Shell. Shell type is denoted on the left side of the Cloud Shell window.

1. If you do not have a virtual machine to use, enter the following commands into the Cloud Shell to create a virtual machine with which to test:

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az group create --resource-group ansible-test-rg --location eastus
  ```

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az vm create --resource-group ansible-test-rg --name ansible-test-vm --image UbuntuLTS --generate-ssh-keys
  ```

1. Use the GNU `wget` command to retrieve the `azure_rm.py` script:

  ```azurecli-interactive
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/contrib/inventory/azure_rm.py
  ```

1. Use the `chmod` command to change the access permissions to the `azure_rm.py` script. The following command uses the `+x` parameter to allow for execution (running) of the specified file (`azure_rm.py`):

  ```azurecli-interactive
  chmod +x azure_rm.py
  ```

1. Use the [ansible command](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/ansible.html) to connect to your virtual machine: 

  ```azurecli-interactive
  ansible -i azure_rm.py ansible-test-vm -m ping
  ```

  Once connected, you should see results similar to the output:

  ```Output
  The authenticity of host 'nn.nnn.nn.nn (nn.nnn.nn.nn)' can't be established.
  ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:&lt;some value>.
  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
  test-ansible-vm | SUCCESS => {
      "changed": false,
      "failed": false,
      "ping": "pong"
  }
  ```

1. If you created a resource group and virtual machine in this section

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az group delete -n <resourceGroup>
  ```

## Run a playbook in Cloud Shell
The [ansible-playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/ansible-playbook.html) command executes Ansible playbooks, running the tasks on the targeted host(s). 
This section walks you through using the Cloud Shell to create and execute two playbooks - one to create a resource group, and a second to delete the resource group. 

1. Create a file named `rg.yml` as follows:

  ```azurecli-interactive
  vi rg.yml
  ```

1. Copy the following contents into the Cloud Shell window (now hosting an instance of the VI editor):

  ```yml
  - name: My first Ansible Playbook
    hosts: localhost
    connection: local
    tasks:
    - name: Create a resource group
      azure_rm_resourcegroup:
        name: demoresourcegroup
        location: eastus
  ```

1. Save the file, and exit the VI editor by entering `:wq` and pressing &lt;Enter>.

1. Use the `ansible-playbook` command to run the `rg.yml` playbook:

  ```azurecli-interactive
  ansible-playbook rg.yml
  ```

1. You should see results similar to the following output:

  ```Output
  PLAY [My first Ansible Playbook] **********

  TASK [Gathering Facts] **********
  ok: [localhost]

  TASK [Create a resource group] **********
  changed: [localhost]

  PLAY RECAP **********
  localhost : ok=2 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=0
  ```

1. Verify the deployment:

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az group show -n demoresourcegroup
  ```

1. Now that you've created the resource group, create a second Ansible playbook to delete the resource group:

  ```azurecli-interactive
  vi rg2.yml
  ```

1. Copy the following contents into the Cloud Shell window (now hosting an instance of the VI editor):

  ```yml
  - name: My second Ansible Playbook
    hosts: localhost
    connection: local
    tasks:
    - name: Delete a resource group
      azure_rm_resourcegroup:
        name: demoresourcegroup
        state: absent
  ```

1. Save the file, and exit the VI editor by entering `:wq` and pressing &lt;Enter>.

1. Use the `ansible-playbook` command to run the `rg2.yml` playbook:

  ```azurecli-interactive
  ansible-playbook rg.yml
  ```

1. You should see results similar to the following output:

  ```Output
  The output is as following. 
  PLAY [My second Ansible Playbook] **********

  TASK [Gathering Facts] **********
  ok: [localhost]

  TASK [Delete a resource group] **********
  changed: [localhost]

  PLAY RECAP **********
  localhost : ok=2 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=0
  ```
