#	Language detection cognitive skill

For up to 120 languages, the **Language Detection** skill detects the language of input text and reports a single language code for every document submitted on the request. The language code is paired with a score indicating the strength of the analysis.

This capability is especially useful when you need to provide the language of the text as input to other skills (for example, the [Sentiment Snalysis skill](cognitive-search-skill-sentiment.md) or [Text Split skill](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md)).

## @odata.type  
Microsoft.Skills.Text.LanguageDetectionSkill

## Data limits
The maximum size of a record should be 50,000 characters as measured by `String.Length`. If you need to break up your data before sending it to the sentiment analyzer, you may use the [Text Split skill](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md).

## Skill inputs

Parameters are case-sensitive.

| Inputs	 | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| text | The text to be analyzed.|

## Skill outputs

| Output Name	 | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| languageCode | The ISO 6391 language code for the language identified. For example, "en". |
| languageName | The name of language. For example "English". |
| score | A value between 0 and 1. The likelihood that language is correctly identified. The score may be lower than 1 if the sentence has mixed languages.  |
