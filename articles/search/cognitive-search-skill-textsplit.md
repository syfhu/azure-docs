#	Text split cognitive skill

The **Text Split** skill breaks text into chunks of text. You can specify whether you want to break the text into sentences or into pages of a particular length. This skill is especially useful if there are maximum text length requirements in other skills downstream. 

## @odata.type  
Microsoft.Skills.Text.SplitSkill 

## Skill Parameters

Parameters are case-sensitive.

| Parameter name	 | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| textSplitMode      | Either "pages" or "sentences" | 
| maximumPageLength	| If textSplitMode is set to "pages", this refers to the maximum page length as measured by `String.Length`. The minimum value is 100. | 
| defaultLanguageCode	| (optional) One of the following language codes: `da, de, en, es, fi, fr, it, ko, pt`. Default is English (en). Few things to consider:<ul><li>If you pass a languagecode-countrycode format, only the languagecode part of the format is used.</li><li>If the language is not in the previous list, the split skill breaks the text at character boundaries.</li><li>Providing a language code is useful to avoid cutting a word in half for non-space languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.</li></ul>  |

## Skill Outputs
