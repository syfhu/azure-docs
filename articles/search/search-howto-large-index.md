# How to scale-out indexing in Azure Seearch

As data volumes grow or processing needs change, you might find that simple [rebuilds and reindexing jobs](search-howto-reindex.md) are not enough. 

As a first step towards meeting increased demands, we recommend that you increase the [scale and capacity](search-capacity-planning.md) within the limits of your existing service. 

A second step, if you can use [indexers](search-indexer-overview.md), adds mechanisms for scaleable indexing. Indexers come with a built-in scheduler that allows you to parcel out indexing at regular intervals or extend processing beyond the 24-hour window. Additionally, when paired with data source definitions, indexers help you achieve a form of parallelism by partitioning data and using schedules to execute in parallel.

### Scheduled indexing for large data sets

Scheduling is an important mechanism for processing large data sets and slow-running analyses like image analysis in a cognitive search pipeline. Indexer processing operates within a 24-hour window. If processing fails to finish within 24 hours, the behaviors of indexer scheduling can work to your advantage. 

By design, scheduled indexing starts at specific intervals, with a job typically completing before resuming at the next scheduled interval. However, if processing does not complete within the interval, the indexer stops (because it ran out of time). At the next interval, processing resumes where it last left off, with the system keeping track of where that occurs. 

In practical terms, for index loads spanning several days, you can put the indexer on a 24-hour schedule. When indexing resumes for the next 24-hour stint, it restarts at the last known good document. In this way, an indexer can work its way through a document backlog over a series of days until all unprocessed documents are processed. For more information about this approach, see [Indexing large datasets](search-howto-indexing-azure-blob-storage.md#indexing-large-datasets)

## Parallel indexing

A second choice is to set up a parallel indexing strategy. For non-routine, computationally intensive indexing requirements, such as OCR on scanned documents in a cognitive search pipeline, a parallel indexing strategy might be the right approach for that specific goal. In a cognitive search enrichment pipeline, image analysis and natural language processing are long running. Parallel indexing on a service that is not simultaneously handling query requests could be a viable option for working through a large body of slow-processing content. 

A strategy for parallel processing has these elements:

+ Divide source data among multiple containers or multiple virtual folders inside the same container. 
+ Map each mini data set to a [date source](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/create-data-source), paired to its own [indexer](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/create-indexer).
+ For cognitive search, reference the same [skillset](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/create-skillset) in each indexer definition.
+ Write into the same target search index. 
+ Schedule all indexers to run at the same time.

> [!Note]
> Azure Search does not support dedicating replicas or partitions to specific workloads. The risk of heavy concurrent indexing is overburdening your system to the detriment of query performance. If you have a test environment, implement parallel indexing there first to understand the tradeoffs.

## Configure parallel indexing

For indexers, processing capacity is loosely based on one indexer subsystem for each service unit (SU) used by your search service. Multiple concurrent indexers are possible on Azure Search services provisioned on Basic or Standard tiers having at least two replicas. 

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), on your search service dashboard **Overview** page, check the **Pricing tier** to confirm it can accommodate parallel indexing. Both Basic and Standard tiers offer multiple replicas.

2. In **Settings** > **Scale**, [increase replicas](search-capacity-planning.md) for parallel processing: one additional replica for each indexer workload. Leave a sufficient number for existing query volume. Sacrificing query workloads for indexing is not a good tradeoff.

3. Distribute data into multiple containers at a level that Azure Search indexers can reach. This could be multiple tables in Azure SQL Database, multiple containers in Azure Blob storage, or multiple collections. Define one data source object for each table or container.

4. Create and schedule multiple indexers to run in parallel:

   + Assume a service with six replicas. Configure six indexers, each one mapped to a data source containing one-sixth of the data set for a 6-way split of the entire data set. 

   + Point each indexer to the same index. For cognitive search workloads, point each indexer to the same skillset.

   + Within each indexer definition, schedule the same run-time execution pattern. For example, `"schedule" : { "interval" : "PT8H", "startTime" : "2018-05-15T00:00:00Z" }` creates a schedule on 2018-05-15 on all indexers, running at eight-hour intervals.

At the scheduled time, all indexers begin execution, loading data, applying enrichments (if you configured a cognitive search pipeline), and writing to the index. Azure Search does not lock the index for updates. Concurrent writes are managed, with retry if a particular write does not succeed on first attempt.

> [!Note]
> When increasing replicas, consider increasing the partition count if index size is projected to increase significantly. Partitions store slices of indexed content; the more partitions you have, the smaller the slice each one has to store.
