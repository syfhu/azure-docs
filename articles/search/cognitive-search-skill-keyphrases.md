#	Key Phrase Extraction cognitive skill

The **Key Phrase Extraction** skill evaluates unstructured text, and for each record, returns a list of key phrases.

This capability is useful if you need to quickly identify the main talking points in the record. For example, given input text "The food was delicious and there were wonderful staff", the service returns "food" and "wonderful staff".

## @odata.type  
Microsoft.Skills.Text.KeyPhraseExtractionSkill 

## Data limits
The maximum size of a record should be 50,000 characters as measured by `String.Length`. If you need to break up your data before sending it to the key phrase extractor, consider using the [Text Split skill](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md).

## Skill parameters

Parameters are case-sensitive.

##	Sample definition

```json
 {
    "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Text.KeyPhraseExtractionSkill",
    "inputs": [
      {
        "name": "text",
        "source": "/document/text"
      },
      {
        "name": "languageCode",
        "source": "/document/languagecode" 
      }
    ],
    "outputs": [
      {
        "name": "keyPhrases",
        "targetName": "myKeyPhrases"
      }
    ]
  }
```

##	Sample input

```json
{
    "values": [
      {
        "recordId": "1",
        "data":
           {
             "text": "Glaciers are huge rivers of ice that ooze their way over land, powered by gravity and their own sheer weight. They accumulate ice from snowfall and lose it through melting. As global temperatures have risen, many of the world’s glaciers have already started to shrink and retreat. Continued warming could see many iconic landscapes – from the Canadian Rockies to the Mount Everest region of the Himalayas – lose almost all their glaciers by the end of the century.",
             "language": "en"
           }
      }
    ]
```


##	Sample output

```json
{
    "values": [
      {
        "recordId": "1",
        "data":
           {
            "keyPhrases": 
            [
              "world’s glaciers", 
              "huge rivers of ice", 
              "Canadian Rockies", 
              "iconic landscapes",
              "Mount Everest region",
              "Continued warming"
            ]
           }
      }
    ]
}
```


## Errors and warnings
If you provide an unsupported language code, an error is generated and key phrases are not extracted.
If your text is empty, a warning will be produced.
If your text is larger than 50,000 characters, only the first 50,000 characters will be analyzed and a warning will be issued.
