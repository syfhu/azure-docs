#	Sentiment cognitive skill

The **Sentiment** skill evaluates unstructured text along a positive-negative continuum, and for each record, returns a numeric score between 0 and 1. Scores close to 1 indicate positive sentiment, and scores close to 0 indicate negative sentiment.

## @odata.type  
Microsoft.Skills.Text.SentimentSkill

## Data limits
The maximum size of a record should be 5000 characters as measured by `String.Length`. If you need to break up your data before sending it to the sentiment analyzer, use the [Text Split skill](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md).


## Skill parameters

Parameters are case-sensitive.

| Parameter Name |                      |
|----------------|----------------------|
| defaultLanguageCode | (optional) The language code to apply to documents that don't specify language explicitly. <br/> See [Full list of supported languages](../cognitive-services/text-analytics/text-analytics-supported-languages.md) |

## Skill inputs 

| Input	Name | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| text | The text to be analyzed.|
| languageCode	|  (Optional) A string indicating the language of the records. If this parameter is not specified, the default value is "en". <br/>See [Full list of supported languages](../cognitive-services/text-analytics/text-analytics-supported-languages.md).|

## Skill outputs

| Output	Name | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| score | A value between 0 and 1 that represents the sentiment of the analyzed text. Values close to 0 have negative sentiment, close to 0.5 have neutral sentiment, and values close to 1 have positive sentiment.|

            "data": {
                "text": "I had a terrible time at the hotel. The staff was rude and the food was awful.",
                "languageCode": "en"
            }

                "score": 0.01
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Notes
If empty, a sentiment score is not returned for those records.

## Error cases
If a language is not supported, an error is generated and no sentiment score is returned.
