# Connect an MXChip IoT DevKit device to your Azure IoT Central application

This article describes how, as a device developer, to connect a MXChip IoT DevKit (DevKit) device to your Microsoft Azure IoT Central application.

## Before you begin

To complete the steps in this article, you need the following:

1. An Azure IoT Central application created from the **Sample Devkits** application template. For more information, see [Create your Azure IoT Central Application](howto-create-application.md).
1. A DevKit device. To purchase a DevKit device, visit [MXChip IoT DevKit](http://mxchip.com/az3166).

An application created from the **Sample Devkits** application template includes a **MXChip** device template with the following characteristics:

### Add a real device

In your Azure IoT Central application, add a real device from the **MXChip** device template and make a note of the device connection string. For more information, see [Add a real device to your Azure IoT Central application](tutorial-add-device.md).

## Prepare the DevKit device

> [!TIP]
> For DevKit device troubleshooting guidance, see [IoT DevKit get started](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/docs/get-started/).

To prepare the DevKit device:

1. Download the latest pre-built Azure IoT Central firmware for the MXChip from the [releases](https://github.com/Azure/iot-central-firmware/releases) page on GitHub. The download filename on the releases page looks like `AZ3166-IoT-Central-X.X.X.bin`.

1. Connect the DevKit device to your development machine using a USB cable. In Windows, a file explorer window opens on a drive mapped to the storage on the DevKit device. For example, the drive might be called **AZ3166 (D:)**.

1. Drag the **iotCentral.bin** file onto the drive window. When the copying is complete, the device reboots with the new firmware.

1. When the DevKit device restarts, the following screen displays:

    ```
    Connect HotSpot:
    AZ3166_??????
    go-> 192.168.0.1 
    PIN CODE xxxxx
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the screen displays anything else, press the **Reset** button on the device. 

1. The device is now in access point (AP) mode. You can connect to this WiFi access point from your computer or mobile device.

1. On your computer, phone, or tablet connect to the WiFi network name shown on the screen of the device. When you connect to this network, you do not have internet access. This state is expected, and you are only connected to this network for a short time while you configure the device.

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://192.168.0.1/start](http://192.168.0.1/start). The following web page displays:

    ![Device configuration page](media/howto-connect-devkit/configpage.png)

    In the web page: 
    - add the name of your WiFi network 
    - your WiFi network password 
    - PIN CODE shown on the device LCD 
    - the connection string of your device. 
      You can find the connection string @ `https://apps.iotcentral.com` -> `Device Explorer` -> `Device` -> `Select or Create a new Real Device` -> `Connect this device` (on the top right) 
    - Select all the available telemetry measurements! 

1. After you choose **Configure Device**, you see this page:

    ![Device configured](media/howto-connect-devkit/deviceconfigured.png)

1. Press the **Reset** button on your device.

> [!NOTE]
> To reconfigure the device to use a different WiFi network, connection string, or telemetry measurement, press both the **A** and **B** buttons on the board simultaneously. If it doesn't work, press **reset** button and try again. 

## View the telemetry

When the DevKit device restarts, the screen on the device shows:

* The number of telemetry messages sent.
* The number of failures.
* The number of desired properties received and the number of reported properties sent.

Shake the device increment the number of reported properties sent. The device sends a random number as the **Die number** device property.

You can view the telemetry measurements and reported property values, and configure settings in Azure IoT Central:

1. Use **Device Explorer** to navigate to the **Measurements** page for the real MXChip device you added:

    ![Navigate to real device](media/howto-connect-devkit/realdevice.png)

1. On the **Measurements** page, you can see the telemetry coming from the MXChip device:

    ![View telemetry from real device](media/howto-connect-devkit/realtelemetry.png)

1. On the **Properties** page, you can view the last die number reported by the device:

    ![View device properties](media/howto-connect-devkit/deviceproperties.png)

1. On the **Settings** page, you can update the settings on the MXChip device:

    ![View device settings](media/howto-connect-devkit/settings.png)

## Download the source code

If you want to explore and modify the device code, you can download it from GitHub. If you plan to modify the code, you should follow these instructions to [prepare the development environment](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/docs/get-started/#step-5-prepare-the-development-environment) for your desktop operating system.

To download the source code, run the following command on your desktop machine:

```cmd/sh
git clone https://github.com/Azure/iot-central-firmware
```

The previous command downloads the source code to a folder called `iot-central-firmware`. 

> [!NOTE]
> If **git** is not installed in your development environment, you can download it from [https://git-scm.com/download](https://git-scm.com/download).

## Review the code

Use Visual Studio Code, which was installed when you prepared your development environment, to open the `AZ3166` folder in the `iot-central-firmware` folder: 

![Visual Studio Code](media/howto-connect-devkit/vscodeview.png)

To see how the telemetry is sent to the Azure IoT Central application, open the **main_telemetry.cpp** file in the source folder.

The function `buildTelemetryPayload` creates the JSON telemetry payload using data from the sensors on the device.

The function `sendTelemetryPayload` calls `sendTelemetry` in the **iotHubClient.cpp** to send the JSON payload to the IoT Hub your Azure IoT Central application uses.

To see how property values are reported to the Azure IoT Central application, open the **main_telemetry.cpp** file in the source folder.

The function `telemetryLoop` sends the **doubleTap** reported property when the accelerometer detects a double tap. It uses the `sendReportedProperty` function in the **iotHubClient.cpp** source file.

The code in the **iotHubClient.cpp** source file uses functions from the [
Microsoft Azure IoT SDKs and libraries for C](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) to interact with IoT Hub.

For information about how to modify, build, and upload the sample code to your device, see the **readme.md** file in the `AZ3166` folder.
