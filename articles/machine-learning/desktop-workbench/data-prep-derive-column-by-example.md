# Derive column by example transformation

The **Derive Column by Example** transform enables users to create a derivative of one or more existing columns using user provided examples of the derived result. The derivative can be any combination of the supported String, Date, and Number transformations. 

Following String, Date, and Number transformations are supported:

**String transformations:** 

Substring including intelligent extraction of Number and Dates, Concatenation, Case Manipulation, Mapping Constant Values.

**Date transformations:** 

Date Format change, Extracting Date Parts, Mapping Time to Time Bins.

The date transformations are fairly generic with a few notable limitations:
* Timezones are unsupported.
* Some common formats that are unsupported:
    * ISO 8601 week of year format (for example “2009-W53-7”) 
    * Unix epoch time.
* All formats are case-sensitive (notably “4am” is not recognized as a time although “4AM” is).

**Number transformations:** 

Round, Floor, Ceiling, Binning, Padding with zeros or space, Division or Multiplication by a power of 1000.

**Composite transformations:** 

Any combination of String, Number, or Date Transformations.

## How to use this transformation

To perform this transform, follow these steps:
1. Select one or more columns that you want to derive the value from. 
2. Select **Derive Column by Example** from the **Transforms** menu. Or, Right click on the header of any of the selected columns and select **Derive Column by Example** from the context menu. The Transform Editor opens and a new column is added next to the right most selected column. Selected columns can be identified by the checkboxes in the column headers. Addition and removal of columns from the selection can be done by using the checkboxes in the column headers.
3. Type an example of the *output* against a row, and press enter. At this point, the Workbench analyzes the input column as well as the provided output to synthesize a program that can transform the given inputs into output. The synthesized program is executed against all the rows in the data grid. For ambiguous and complicated cases, multiple examples may be needed. Depending on whether you are in Basic Mode or Advanced Mode, multiple examples can be provided in different ways.
4. Review the output and Click **OK** to accept the transform.

### Transform editor: basic mode

Basic Mode provides an inline editing experience in the data grid. You can provide examples of the output by navigating to the cell of interest and typing the value. 

The workbench analyses the data and tries to identify the edge cases that should be reviewed by the user. While the data is being analyzed, **Analyzing Data** is shown in the header of the Transform Editor. One the analysis is complete, either **No Suggestions** or, **Review next suggested row** is displayed in the header. You can navigate through the edge cases by clicking on **Review next suggested row**. In case the value is incorrect for a row, you should key in the correct value as additional example. 

### Transform editor: advanced mode

Advanced Mode provides a richer experience for Deriving columns by example. All the examples are shown at one place. You can also review all the edge cases at one place by clicking on **Show suggested examples**. 

In the advanced mode, you can add any row as an example row by double-clicking on the row in the grid. One a row is copied as an example row, you can also edit the data in the source columns to make a synthetic example. By doing so, you can add cases that are not currently present in the sample data.

User can switch between the **Basic Mode** and the **Advanced Mode** by clicking the links in the Transform Editor.

### Transform editor: Send Feedback

Clicking on the **Send feedback** link opens the **Feedback** dialog with the comments box prepopulated with the examples user has provided. User should review the content of the comments box and provide more details to help us understand the issue. If the user does not want to share data with Microsoft, user should delete the prepopulated example data before clicking the **Send Feedback** button. 

### Editing existing transformation

A user can edit an existing **Derive Column By Example** transform by selecting **Edit** option of the Transformation Step. Clicking on **Edit** opens the Transform Editor in **Advanced Mode**, and all the examples that were provided during creation of the transform are shown.

## Technical notes

### Conditional transformations
In some cases, a single transformation cannot be found that satisfies the given examples. In such cases, Derive Column by Example Transform attempts to group the inputs based on some pattern and learn separate transformation for each group. We call this **Conditional Transformation**. **Conditional Transformation** is attempted only for transformations with a single input column. 

### Reference
More information about the String Transformation by Example technology can be found in [this publication](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/automating-string-processing-spreadsheets-using-input-output-examples/).
