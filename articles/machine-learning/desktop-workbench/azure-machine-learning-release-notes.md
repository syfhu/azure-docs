Welcome to the third update of Azure Machine Learning. This update includes improvements in the workbench app, the Command-line Interface (CLI), and the back-end services. Thank you very much for sending the smiles and frowns. Many of the following updates are made as direct results of your feedback. 

**Notable New Features**
- [Support for SQL Server and Azure SQL DB as a data source](data-prep-appendix2-supported-data-sources.md#types) 
- [Deep Learning on Spark with GPU support using MMLSpark](https://github.com/Azure/mmlspark/blob/master/docs/gpu-setup.md)
- [All AML containers are compatible with Azure IoT Edge devices when deployed (no extra steps required)](http://aka.ms/aml-iot-edge-blog)
- Registered model list and detail views available Azure portal
- Accessing compute targets using SSH key-based authentication in addition to username/password-based access. 
- New Pattern Frequency Inspector in the data prep experience. 

**Detailed Updates**
Following is a list of detailed updates in each component area of Azure Machine Learning in this sprint.

### Installer
- Installer can self update so that bugs fixes and new features can be supported without user having to reinstall it

### Workbench Authentication
- Multiple fixes to authentication system. Please let us know if you are still experiencing login issues.
- UI changes that make it easier to find the Proxy Manager settings.

### Workbench
- Read-only file view now has light blue background
- Moved Edit button to the right to make it more discoverable.
- "dsource", "dprep", and "ipynb" file formats can now be rendered in raw text format
- The workbench now has a new editing experience that guides users towards using external IDEs to edit scripts, and use Workbench only to edit file types that have a rich editing experience (such as Notebooks, Data sources, Data preparation packages)
- Loading the list of workspaces and projects that the user has access to is significantly faster now

### Data preparation 
- A Pattern Frequency Inspector to view the string patterns in a column. You can also filter your data using these patterns. This shows you a view similar to the Value Counts inspector. The difference is that Pattern Frequency shows the counts of the unique patterns of the data, rather than the counts of unique data. You can also filter in or out all rows that fit a certain pattern.

![Image of pattern frequency inspector on Product Number](media/azure-machine-learning-release-notes/pattern-inspector-product-number.png)

- Performance improvements while recommending edge cases to review in the 'derive column by example' transformation

- [Support for SQL Server and Azure SQL DB as a data source](data-prep-appendix2-supported-data-sources.md#types) 

![Image of creating a new SQL server data source](media/azure-machine-learning-release-notes/sql-server-data-source.png)

- Enabled "At a glance" view of row and column counts

![Image of row column count at a grace](media/azure-machine-learning-release-notes/row-col-count.png)

- Data prep is enabled in all compute contexts
- Data sources that use a SQL Server database are enabled in all compute contexts
- Data prep grid columns can be filtered by data type
- Fixed issue with converting multiple columns to date
- Fixed issue that user could select output column as a source in Derive Column By Example if user changed output column name in the advanced mode.

### Job execution
You can now create and access a remotedocker or cluster type compute target using SSH key-based authentication following these steps:
- Attach a compute target using the following command in CLI

    ```azure-cli
    $ az ml computetarget attach remotedocker --name "remotevm" --address "remotevm_IP_address" --username "sshuser" --use-azureml-ssh-key
    ```
>[!NOTE]
>-k (or --use-azureml-ssh-key) option in the command specifies to generate and use SSH-key.

- Azure ML Workbench will generate a public key and output that in your console. Log into the compute target using the same username and append ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file with this public key.

- You can prepare this compute target and use it for execution and Azure ML Workbench will use this key for authentication.  

For more information on creating compute targets, see [Configuring Azure Machine Learning Experimentation Service](experimentation-service-configuration.md)

### Visual Studio Tools for AI
- Added support for [Visual Studio Tools for AI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.vstoolsai-vs2017). 

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Added `az ml datasource create` command allows to creating a data source file from the command-line

### Breaking changes
- Promoted the `--type` switch in `az ml computetarget attach` to a subcommand. 

    - `az ml computetarget attach --type remotedocker` is now `az ml computetarget attach remotedocker`
    - `az ml computetarget attach --type cluster` is now `az ml computetarget attach cluster`

## 2017-11 (Sprint 1) 
**Version number**: 0.1.1710.31013  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;([Find your version](../service/known-issues-and-troubleshooting-guide.md#find-the-workbench-build-number))

In this release, we've made improvements around security, stability, and maintainability in the workbench app, the CLI, and the back-end services layer. Thanks very much for sending us smiles and frowns. Many of the below updates are made as direct results of your feedback. Keep them coming!

### Notable New Features
- Azure ML is now available in two new Azure regions: **West Europe** and **Southeast Asia**. They join the previous regions of **East US 2**, **West Central US**, and **Australia East**, bringing the total number of deployed regions to five.
- We enabled Python code syntax highlighting in the Workbench app to make it easier to read and edit Python source code. 
- You can now launch your favorite IDE directly from a file, rather than from the whole project.  Opening a file in Workbench and then clicking "Edit" launches your IDE (currently VS Code and PyCharm are supported) to the current file and project.  You can also click the arrow next to the Edit button to edit the file in the Workbench text editor.  Files are read-only until you click Edit, preventing accidental changes.
- The popular plotting library `matplotlib` version 2.1.0 is now shipped with the Workbench app.
- We upgraded the .NET Core version to 2.0 for the data prep engine. This removed the requirement for brew-install openssl during app installation on macOS. It also paves the way for more exciting data prep features to come in the near future. 
- We have enabled a version-specific app homepage, so you get more relevant release notes and update prompts based on your current app version.
- If your local user name has a space in it, the application can now be successfully installed. 

### Detailed Updates

## 2017-10 (Sprint 0) 
**Version number**: 0.1.1710.31013  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;([Find your version](../service/known-issues-and-troubleshooting-guide.md#find-the-workbench-build-number))

Welcome to the first update of Azure Machine Learning Workbench following our initial public preview at the Microsoft Ignite 2017 conference. The main updates in this release are reliability and stabilization fixes.  Some of the critical issues we addressed include:

### New features
- macOS High Sierra is now supported

### Bug fixes
#### Workbench experience
- Drag and drop a file into Workbench causes the Workbench to crash.
- The terminal window in VS Code configured as an IDE for Workbench does not recognize _az ml_ commands.

#### Workbench authentication
We made a number of updates to improve various login and authentication issues reported.
- Authentication window keeps popping-up, particularly when Internet connection is not stable.
- Improved reliability issues around authentication token expiration.
- In some cases, authentication window appears twice.
- Workbench main window still displays "authenticating" message when the authentication process has finished and the pop-up dialog box already dismissed.
- If there is no Internet connection, the authentication dialog pops up with a blank screen.

#### Data preparation 
- When a specific value is filtered, errors and missing values are also filtered out.
- Changing a sampling strategy removes subsequent existing join operations.
- Replacing Missing Value transform does not take NaN into consideration.
- Date type inference throws exception when null value encountered.

#### Job execution
- There is no clear error message when job execution fails to upload project folder because it exceeded the size limit.
- If user's Python script changes the working directory, the files written to outputs folders are not tracked. 
- If the active Azure subscription is different than the one the current project belongs to, job submission results a 403 error.
- When Docker is not present, no clear error message is returned if user tries to use Docker as an execution target.
- .runconfig file is not saved automatically when user clicks on _Run_ button.

#### Jupyter Notebook
- Notebook server cannot start if user uses with certain login types.
- Notebook server error messages do not surface in logs visible to user.

#### Azure portal
- Selecting the dark theme of Azure portal causes Model Management blade to display as a black box.

#### Operationalization
- Reusing a manifest to update a web service causes a new Docker image built with a random name.
- Web service logs cannot be retrieved from Kubernetes cluster.
- Misleading error message is printed when user attempts to create a Model Management account or an ML Compute account and encounters permissions issues.
