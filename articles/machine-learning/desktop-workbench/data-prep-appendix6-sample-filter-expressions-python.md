# Sample of filter expressions (Python) 
Before you read this appendix, read [Python extensibility overview](data-prep-python-extensibility-overview.md).

## Filter with equivalence test
Filter in only those rows where the value of (numeric) Col2 is greater than 4. 

```python
    row["Col2"] > 4
```

## Filter with multiple columns 
Filter in only those rows where Col1 contains the value **Good** and Col2 contains the (numeric) value 1. 
```python
    row["Col1"] == 'Good' and row["Col2"] == 1
```

## Test filter against null
Filter in only those rows where Col1 has a null value. 
```python
    pd.isnull(row["Col1"])
```
