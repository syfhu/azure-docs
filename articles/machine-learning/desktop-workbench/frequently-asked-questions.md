# Azure Machine Learning frequently asked questions

Azure Machine Learning is a fully managed Azure service that allows you to create, test, manage, and deploy machine learning and AI models. Our services and downloadable application offer a code-first approach that leverages the cloud, on-premises, and edge to provide the train, deploy, manage, and monitor models with power, speed, and flexibility. Alternatively, Azure Machine Learning Studio offers a browser-based, visual drag-and-drop authoring environment where no coding is required. 

## General product questions

**What other Azure services are required?**

Azure Blob Storage and Azure Container Registry are used by Azure Machine Learning. In addition, you will need to provision compute resources such as a Data Science VM or HDInsight cluster. Compute and hosting are also required when deploying your web services, such as [Azure Container Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks).

**How does Azure Machine Learning relate to Microsoft Machine Learning Services in SQL Server 2017?**	

Machine Learning Services in SQL Server 2017 is an extensible, scalable platform for integrating machine learning tasks into database workflows. It is a perfect fit for scenarios where an on-premises solution is required, for example where data movement is expensive or untenable. In contrast, cloud or hybrid workloads are a great fit for our new Azure services. 

**Do you support both Python and R? What about other programming languages like C++**

We currently support Python only. We are working on R integration and expect to have it available soon. 

**How does Azure Machine Learning relate to Microsoft Machine Learning for Spark?**

MMLSpark provides deep learning and data science tools for Apache Spark, with emphasis on productivity, ease of experimentation and state-of-the-art algorithms. MMLSpark offers integration of Spark Machine Learning pipelines with the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit and OpenCV. You can create powerful, highly scalable predictive, and analytical models for image and text data. MMLSpark is available under an open-source license and is included in AML Workbench as a set of consumable models and algorithms. For more information on MMLSpark, visit our product documentation. 

**Which versions of Spark are supported by the new tools and services?**

Workbench currently includes and supports MMLSpark version 0.8, which is compatible with Apache Spark 2.1. You also have an option to use GPU-enabled Docker image of MMLSpark 0.8 on Linux virtual machines.

## Experimentation Service

**What is the Azure Machine Learning Experimentation Service?**

The Experimentation Service is a managed Azure service that takes machine learning experimentation to the next level. Experiments can be built locally or in the cloud. Rapidly prototype on a desktop, then scale to virtual machines or Spark clusters. Azure VMs with the latest GPU technology allow you to engage in deep learning quickly and effectively. We’ve also included deep integration with Git so you can plug easily into existing workflows for code tracking, configuration, and collaboration. 

**How will I be charged for the Experimentation Service?**

The first two users associated with your Azure Machine Learning Experimentation Service are free. Additional users will be charged at the Public Preview rate of $50 / month. For more information on pricing and billing, visit our Pricing page.

**Will I be charged based on how many experiments I run?**

No, the Experimentation Service allows as many experiments as you need and charges only based on the number of users. Experimentation compute resources are charged separately. We encourage you to perform multiple experiments so you can find the best fitting model for your solution.   

**What specific kinds of compute and storage resources can I use?**

The Experimentation service can execute your experiments on local machines (direct or Docker-based), [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/), and [HDInsight](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/). The service also accesses an [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/) account for storing execution outputs and can leverage a [Visual Studio Team Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-team-services/) account for version-control and Git storage. Note that you will be billed independently for any consumed compute and storage resources, based upon their individual pricing.  


## Model Management

**What is Azure Machine Learning Model Management?**

Azure Machine Learning Model Management is a managed Azure service that allows data scientists and dev-ops teams to deploy predictive models reliably into a wide variety of environments. Git repositories and Docker containers provide traceability and repeatability. Models can be deployed reliably in the cloud, on-premises, or edge. Once in production, you can manage model performance, then proactively retrain if performance degrades. You can deploy models on local machines, to [Azure VMs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/), Spark on [HDInsight](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/) or Kubernetes-orchestrated [Azure Container Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-service/) clusters.  

**What is a "model"?**

A model is the output of an experimentation run that has been promoted for model management. A model that is registered in the hosting account is counted against your plan, including models updated through retraining or version iteration.

**What is a "managed model?"**

A model is the output of a training process and is the application of a machine learning algorithm to training data. Model Management enables you to deploy models as web services, manage various versions of your models, and monitor their performance and metrics. "Managed" models have been registered with an Azure Machine Learning Model Management account. As an example, consider a scenario where you are trying to forecast sales. During the experimentation phase, you generate many models by using different data sets or algorithms. You have generated four models with varying accuracies but choose to register only the model with the highest accuracy. The model that is registered becomes your first managed model.
 
**What is a "deployment?"**

Model Management allows you to deploy models as packaged web service containers in Azure. These web services can be invoked using REST APIs. Each web service is counted as a single deployment, and the total number of active deployments are counted towards your plan. Using the sales forecasting example, when you deploy your best performing model, your plan is incremented by one deployment. If you then retrain and deploy another version, you have two deployments. If you determine that the newer model is better, and delete the original, your deployment count is decremented by one.  

**What specific compute resources are available for my deployments?** 

Model Management can run your deployments as Docker containers registered to [Azure Container Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-service/), as [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/), or on local machines. Additional deployment targets will be added shortly. Note that you will be billed independently for any consumed compute resources, based upon their individual pricing.     

**Can I use the Azure Machine Learning Model Management to deploy models built using tools other than the Experimentation Service?**

You get the best experience when you deploy models created using the Experimentation Service. However, you can deploy models built using other frameworks and tools. We support a variety of models including  MMLSpark, TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, scikit-learn, Keras, etc. 

**Can I use my own Azure resources?**

Yes, the Experimentation Service and Model Management work in conjunction with multiple Azure data stores, compute workloads, and other services. Refer to our technical documentation for further details on required Azure services.

**Do you support both on-premises and cloud deployment scenarios?**

Yes. We support on-premises and cloud deployment scenarios via Docker containers. Local execution targets include: single-node Docker deployments, [Microsoft SQL Server with ML Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/advanced-analytics/r/r-services), Hadoop, or Spark. We also support cloud deployments via Docker, including: clustered deployments via Azure Container Service and Kubernetes, HDInsight, or Spark clusters. Edge scenarios are supported via Docker containers and Azure IOT Edge. 

**Can I run a Docker image that was created using the Azure Machine Learning CLI on another host?**

Yes. You can use the image as a web service on any docker host as long as host has sufficient compute resources for hosting the docker image.

**Do you support retraining of deployed models?**

Yes, you can deploy multiple versions of the same model. Model Management will support  service updates for all updated models and images.

## Workbench

**What is the Azure Machine Learning Workbench?**

The Azure Machine Learning Workbench is a companion application built for professional data scientists. Available for Windows and Mac, the Machine Learning Workbench provides overview, management, and control for machine learning solutions.
