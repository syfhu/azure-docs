# Tutorial: Classifying Iris using the command-line interface
Azure Machine Learning services (preview) are an integrated, end-to-end data science and advanced analytics solution for professional data scientists to prepare data, develop experiments and deploy models at cloud scale.

In this tutorial, you learn to use the command-line interface (CLI) tools in Azure Machine Learning preview features to: 
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Set up an Experimentation account and create a workspace
> * Create a project
> * Submit an experiment to multiple compute targets
> * Promote and register a trained model
> * Deploy a web service to score new data

## Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you need:
- Access to an Azure subscription and permissions to create resources in that subscription. 
  
  If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

- Azure Machine Learning Workbench application installed as described in [Quickstart: Install and start Azure Machine Learning services](../service/quickstart-installation.md). 

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >Do not create the Azure Machine Learning service accounts since you will do that using the CLI in this article.
 
## Getting started
Azure Machine Learning command-line interface (CLI) allows you to perform all tasks required for an end-to-end data science workflow. You can access the CLI tools in the following ways:

### Option 1. launch Azure ML CLI from Azure ML Workbench log-in dialog box
When you launch Azure ML Workbench and log in for the first time, and if you don't have access to an Experimentation Account already, you are presented with the following screen:

![no account found](media/tutorial-iris-azure-cli/no_account_found.png)

Click on the **Command Line Window** link in the dialog box to launch the command-line window.

### Option 2. launch Azure ML CLI from Azure ML Workbench app
If you already have access to an Experimentation Account, you can log in successfully. And you can then open the command-line window by clicking on **File** --> **Open Command Prompt** menu.

### Option 3. enable Azure ML CLI in an arbitrary command-line window
You can also enable Azure ML CLI in any command-line window. Do so by launching a command window, and enter the following commands:

```sh
# Windows Command Prompt
set PATH=%LOCALAPPDATA%\amlworkbench\Python;%LOCALAPPDATA%\amlworkbench\Python\Scripts;%PATH%

# Windows PowerShell
$env:Path = $env:LOCALAPPDATA+"\amlworkbench\Python;"+$env:LOCALAPPDATA+"\amlworkbench\Python\Scripts;"+$env:Path

# macOS Bash Shell
PATH=$HOME/Library/Caches/AmlWorkbench/Python/bin:$PATH
```
To make the change permanent, you can use `SETX` on Windows. For macOS, you can use `setenv`.

>[!TIP]
>You can enable Azure CLI in your favorite terminal window by setting the preceding environment variables.

## Step 1. Log in to Azure
The first step is to open the CLI from the AMLWorkbench App (File > Open Command Prompt). Doing so ensures that you have the correct python environment and that the ML CLI commands are available. 

Now, you can set the right context in your CLI to access and manage Azure resources.
 
```azure-cli
# log in
$ az login

# list all subscriptions
$ az account list -o table

# set the current subscription
$ az account set -s <subscription id or name>
```

## Step 2. Create a new Azure Machine Learning Experimentation Account and Workspace

In this step, you create a new Experimentation account and a new workspace. See [Azure Machine Learning concepts](overview-general-concepts.md) for more details about experimentation accounts and workspaces.

> [!NOTE]
> Experimentation accounts require a storage account, which is used to store the outputs of your experiment runs. The storage account name has to be globally unique in Azure because there is an url associated with it. If you don't specify an existing storage account, your experimentation account name is used to create a new storage account. Make sure to use a unique name, or you will get an error such as _"The storage account named \<storage_account_name> is already taken."_ Alternatively, you can use the `--storage` argument to supply an existing storage account.

```azure-cli
# create a resource group 
$ az group create --name <resource group name> --location <supported Azure region>

# create a new experimentation account with a new storage account
$ az ml account experimentation create --name <experimentation account name> --resource-group <resource group name>

# create a new experimentation account with an existing storage account
$ az ml account experimentation create --name <experimentation account name>  --resource-group <resource group name> --storage <storage account Azure Resource ID>

# create a workspace in the experimentation account
az ml workspace create --name <workspace name> --account <experimentation account name> --resource-group <resource group name>
```

## Step 2.a (optional) Share a workspace with co-worker
Here you can explore how to share access to a workspace with a co-worker. The steps to share access to an experimentation account or to a project would be the same. Only the way of getting the Azure Resource ID would need to be updated.

```azure-cli
# find the workspace Azure Resource ID
$az ml workspace show --name <workspace name> --account <experimentation account name> --resource-group <resource group name>

# add Bob to this workspace as a new owner
$az role assignment create --assignee bob@contoso.com --role owner --scope <workspace Azure Resource ID>
```

> [!TIP]
> `bob@contoso.com` in the above command must be a valid Azure AD identity in the directory where the current subscription belongs to.

## Step 3. Create a new project
Our next step is to create a new project. There are several ways to get started with a new project.

### Create a new blank project

```azure-cli
# create a new project
$ az ml project create --name <project name> --workspace <workspace name> --account <experimentation account name> --resource-group <resource group name> --path <local folder path>
```

### Create a new project with a default project template
You can create a new project with a default template.

```azure-cli
$ az ml project create --name <project name> --workspace <workspace name> --account <experimentation account name> --resource-group <resource group name> --path <local folder path> --template
```

### Create a new project associated with a cloud Git repository
You can create a new project associated with a VSTS (Visual Studio Team Service) Git repository. Every time an experiment is submitted, a snapshot of the entire project folder is committed to the remote Git repo. See [Using Git repository with an Azure Machine Learning Workbench project](using-git-ml-project.md) for more details.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Machine Learning only supports empty Git repos created in VSTS.

```azure-cli
$ az ml project create --name <project name> --workspace <workspace name> --account <experimentation account name> --resource-group <resource group name> --path <local folder path> --repo <VSTS repo URL>
```
> [!TIP]
> If you are getting an error "Repository url might be invalid or user might not have access", you can create a security token in VSTS (under _Security_, _Add personal access tokens_ menu) and use the `--vststoken` argument when creating your project. 

### <a name="sample_create"></a>Create a new project from a sample
In this example, you create a new project using a sample project as a template.

```azure-cli
# List the project samples, find the Classifying Iris sample
$ az ml project sample list

# Create a new project from the sample
az ml project create --name <project name> --workspace <workspace name> --account <experimentation account name> --resource-group <resource group name> --path <local folder path> --template-url https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/MachineLearningSamples-Iris
```
Once your project is created, use `cd` command to enter the project directory.

## Step 4 Run the training experiment 
The following steps assume that you have a project with the Iris sample (see [Create a new project from an online sample](#sample_create)).

### Prepare your environment 
For the Iris sample, you must install matplotlib.

```azure-cli
$ pip install matplotlib
```

###  Submit the experiment

```azure-cli
# Execute the file
$ az ml experiment submit --run-configuration local iris_sklearn.py
```

### Iterate on your experiment with descending regularization rates
With some creativity, it's simple to put together a Python script that submits experiments with different regularization rates. (You might have to edit the file to point to the right project path.)

```azure-cli
$ python run.py
```

## Step 5. View run history
Following command lists all the previous runs executed. 

```azure-cli
$ az ml history list -o table
```
Running the preceding command displays a list of all the runs belonging to this project. You can see that accuracy and regularization rate metrics are listed too. This makes it easy to identify the best run from the list.

## Step 5.a View attachment created by a given run 
To view the attachment associated with a given run, you can use the info command of run history. Find a run ID of a specific run from the preceding list.

```azure-cli
$ az ml history info --run <run id> --artifact driver_log
```

To download the artifacts from a run, you can use below command:

```azure-cli
# Stream a given attachment 
$ az ml history info --run <run id> --artifact <artifact location>
```

## Step 6. Promote artifacts of a run 
One of the runs has a better AUC, so this is the one to use when creating a scoring web service to deploy to production. In order to do so, you first need to promote the artifacts into an asset.

```azure-cli
$ az ml history promote --run <run id> --artifact-path outputs/model.pkl --name model.pkl
```

This creates an `assets` folder in your project directory with a `model.pkl.link` file. This link file is used to reference a promoted asset.

## Step 7. Download the files to be operationalized
Download the promoted model so you can use them to create a prediction web service. 

```azure-cli
$ az ml asset download --link-file assets\pickle.link -d asset_download
```

## Step 8. Set up your model management environment 
Create an environment to deploy web services. You can run the web service on the local machine using Docker. Or deploy it to an ACS cluster for high-scale operations. 

```azure-cli
# Create new local operationalization environment
$ az ml env setup -l <supported Azure region> -n <env name>
# Once setup is complete, set your environment for current context
$ az ml env set -g <resource group name> -n <env name>
```

## Step 9. Create a model management account 
A model management account is required to deploy and track your models in production. 

```azure-cli
$ az ml account modelmanagement create -n <model management account name> -g <resource group name> -l <supported Azure region>
```

## Step 10. Create a web service
Create a web service that returns a prediction using the model you deployed. 

```azure-cli
$ az ml service create realtime -m asset_download/model.pkl -f score_iris.py -r python –n <web service name>
```

## Step 11. Run the web service
Using the web service ID from the output of the previous step, call the web service and test it. 

```azure-cli
# Get web service usage infomration
$ az ml service usage realtime -i <web service id>

# Call the web service with the run command:
$ az ml service run realtime -i <web service id> -d <input data>
```

## Step 12. Deleting all the resources 
Let's complete this tutorial by deleting all the resources that were created, unless you want to keep working on it. 

To do so, delete the resource group holding the resources. 

```azure-cli
az group delete --name <resource group name>
```
