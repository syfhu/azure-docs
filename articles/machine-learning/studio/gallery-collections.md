# Discover and share collections in Azure AI Gallery
[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-gallery-item-selector](../../../includes/machine-learning-gallery-item-selector.md)]

## Collections
You can use a [collection](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/collections) to group experiments, APIs, and other Gallery items that you use for a specific solution or concept. You can group them to use, to save for later reference, or to share.

## Discover
To browse collections [in the Gallery](http://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com), under **More**, select **Collections**.

![Select Collections on the Gallery home page](./media/gallery-collections/select-collections-in-gallery.png)

The **[Collections](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/collections)** page displays a list of recently added and popular collections. To view all collections, select **See all**. To search for a specific collection, select **See all**, and then select filter criteria. You also can enter search terms in the **Search** box at the top of the Gallery page.

You can get more information about a collection on the collection details page. To open a collection details page, select the collection. On a collection details page, in the **Comments** section, you can comment, provide feedback, or ask questions about the collection. You can even share the collection with friends or colleagues on Twitter or LinkedIn. You also can email a link to the collection details page, to invite other users to view the page.

## Contribute
You can create a collection that has items that you own or items that have been contributed by the community. An item in a collection can be any Gallery item that addresses a specific solution or concept.

For example, you can use a collection to group items on a specific topic, or you can group a multi-step experiment that solves a complex problem. The initial collections contributed by Microsoft consist of multi-step machine learning experiment templates. You can use the templates to help solve real-world problems, such as online fraud detection, text classification, retail forecasting, or predictive maintenance.

### Create a collection

1. Sign in to the Gallery by using your Microsoft account.

2.  Select your image at the top of the page, and then select your name.
  
    ![Select your account name](./media/gallery-collections/click-account-name.png)

3. Select **New Item**.
   
    ![Select "New Item"](./media/gallery-collections/click-new-item.png)
4. On the **Description** page, for **ITEM TYPE**, select **Collection**. Enter a name for your collection, a brief summary, a detailed description, and any tags that might help other users find your collection.
   
    ![Enter information for a new collection](./media/gallery-collections/create-collection-page-1.png)
5. On the **Image Selection** page, select an image that is displayed with the collection. You can upload your own image file, or select a stock image. Choose an image that might help users identify the content and purpose of the collection.
   
    ![Enter information for a new collection](./media/gallery-collections/create-collection-page-2.png)
6. On the **Settings** page, for **Visibility**, select whether the collection is **Public** (anyone can view the collection) or **Unlisted** (only people with a direct link to the collection can view it).
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > After you set a collection to **Public** and then select **Create**, you cannot later change the collection to **Unlisted**.
   > 
   > 
   
    ![Select "Public" or "Unlisted"](./media/gallery-collections/create-collection-page-3.png)

Your collection is now in Azure AI Gallery. Your collections are listed on your account page, on the **Collection** tab.

### Add items to a collection
To add items to your collection, open the collection, select **Edit**, and then select **Add Item**.

![Add items to a collection from the details page](./media/gallery-collections/add-to-collection-from-details-page.png)

A list of items you've contributed to the Gallery is shown on your account page. You also can search the Gallery for items to add. Select the items that you want to add. Every item that you select is included in the set of items to add. The **Add** button indicates how many items you have selected.

![Add to collection](./media/gallery-collections/add-to-collection.png)

While you are editing your collection, you can change the order of the items in the collection. Use the arrow buttons next to an item to move it up or down in the order list. 

To add notes to the items in your collection, select the upper-right corner of an item, and then select **Add/Edit note**.
