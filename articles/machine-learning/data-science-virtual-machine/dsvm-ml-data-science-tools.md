# Machine learning and data science tools
The Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) has a rich set of tools and libraries for machine learning available in popular languages like Python, R, Julia. 

Here are some of the machine learning tools and libraries on the DSVM. 

## XGBoost 
|    |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is it?   |    Fast, Portable, and Distributed Gradient Boosting (GBDT, GBRT, or GBM) Library, for Python, R, Java, Scala, C++ and more. Runs on single machine, Hadoop, Spark    |
| Supported DSVM Editions     | Windows, Linux     |
| Typical Uses      | General ML library      |
| How is it configured / installed on the DSVM?      |  Installed with GPU support   |
| How to use / run it?      | As Python Library (2.7 and 3.5), R package and on path command-line tool (`C:\dsvm\tools\xgboost\bin\xgboost.exe` for Windows, `/dsvm/tools/xgboost/xgboost` for Linux)    |
| Links to Samples      | Samples are included on the VM, in `/dsvm/tools/xgboost/demo` on Linux and `C:\dsvm\tools\xgboost\demo` on Windows   |
| Related Tools on the DSVM      | LightGBM, MXNet   |



## Vowpal Wabbit
|    |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is it?   |   Vowpal Wabbit (also known as "VW") is an open source fast out-of-core learning system library    |
| Supported DSVM Editions     | Windows, Linux     |
| Typical Uses      | General ML library      |
| How is it configured / installed on the DSVM?      |  Windows - msi installer, Linux - apt-get |
| How to use / run it?      | As a on path Command-line tool (`C:\Program Files\VowpalWabbit\vw.exe` on Windows, `/usr/bin/vw` on Linux)    |
| Links to Samples      | [VowPal Wabbit samples](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Examples) |
| Related Tools on the DSVM      |LightGBM, MXNet, XGBoost   |


## Weka
|    |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is it?   |  Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from your own Java code. Weka contains tools for data pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization. |
| Supported DSVM Editions     | Windows, Linux     |
| Typical Uses      | General ML Tool     |
| How to use / run it?      | On Windows, search for Weka in the Start Menu. On Linux, log in with X2Go, then navigate to Applications -> Development -> Weka. |

## Rattle
|    |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is it?   |   A Graphical User Interface for Data Mining using R   |
| Supported DSVM Editions     | Windows, Linux     |
| Typical Uses      | General UI Data Mining tool for R    |
| How to use / run it?      | UI tool. On Windows, start a Command Prompt, run R, then inside R run `rattle()`. On Linux, connect with X2Go, start a terminal, run R, then inside R run `rattle()`. |

## LightGBM
|    |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is it?   | A fast, distributed, high-performance gradient boosting (GBDT, GBRT, GBM, or MART) framework based on decision tree algorithms, used for ranking, classification, and many other machine learning tasks.    |
| Supported DSVM Versions      | Windows, Linux    |
| Typical Uses      | General-purpose gradient boosting framework      |
| How is it configured / installed on the DSVM?      | On Windows, LightGBM is installed as a Python package. On Linux, the command-line executable is in `/opt/LightGBM/lightgbm`, the R package is installed, and Python packages are installed.     |

| Related Tools on the DSVM      | MXNet, XgBoost  |

## H2O
|    |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is it?   | An open-source AI platform supporting in-memory, distributed, fast, and scalable machine learning  |
| Supported DSVM Versions      | Linux   |
| Typical Uses      | General Purpose distributed, scalable ML   |
| How is it configured / installed on the DSVM?      | H2O is installed in `/dsvm/tools/h2o`.      |
| How to use / run it?      | Connect to the VM using X2Go. Start a new terminal and run `java -jar /dsvm/tools/h2o/current/h2o.jar`. Then start a web browser and connect to `http://localhost:54321`.      |
