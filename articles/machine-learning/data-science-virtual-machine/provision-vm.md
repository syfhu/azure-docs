Doing data science involves iterating on a sequence of tasks:

1. Finding, loading, and pre-processing data
2. Building and testing models
3. Deploying the models for consumption in intelligent applications

Data scientists use a variety of tools to complete these tasks. It can be quite time consuming to find the appropriate versions of the software, and then download and install them. The Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine can ease this burden by providing a ready-to-use image that can be provisioned on Azure with all several popular tools pre-installed and configured. 

The Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine jump-starts your analytics project. It enables you to work on tasks in various languages including R, Python, SQL, and C#. Visual Studio provides an IDE to develop and test your code that is easy to use. The Azure SDK included in the VM allows you to build your applications using various services on Microsoft’s cloud platform. 

There are no software charges for this data science VM image. You only pay for the Azure usage fees which dependent on the size of the virtual machine you provision. More details on the compute fees can be found in the Pricing details section on the [Data Science Virtual Machine](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/microsoft-ads.windows-data-science-vm?tab=PlansAndPrice) page. 

## Other Versions of the Data Science Virtual Machine
An [Ubuntu](dsvm-ubuntu-intro.md) image is available as well, with many similar tools plus a few additional deep learning frameworks. A [CentOS](linux-dsvm-intro.md) image is also available. We also offer a [Windows Server 2012 edition](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/microsoft-ads.standard-data-science-vm) of the data science virtual machine though a few tools are only available on the Windows Server 2016 edition.  Otherwise, this article also applies to the Windows Server 2012 edition.

## Tools installed on the Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine



### Microsoft ML Server Developer Edition
If you wish to use Microsoft enterprise libraries for scalable R or Python for your analytics, the VM has Microsoft ML Server Developer edition (Previously known as Microsoft R Server) installed. Microsoft ML Server is a broadly deployable enterprise-class analytics platform available for both R and Python and is  scalable, commercially supported and secure. Supporting a variety of big data statistics, predictive modeling and machine learning capabilities, ML Server supports the full range of analytics – exploration, analysis, visualization, and modeling. By using and extending open source R and Python, Microsoft ML Server is fully compatible with R / Python scripts, functions and CRAN / pip / Conda packages, to analyze data at enterprise scale. It also addresses the in-memory limitations of Open Source R by adding parallel and chunked processing of data. This enables you to run analytics on data much bigger than what fits in main memory.  Visual Studio Community Edition included on the VM contains the R Tools for Visual Studio and Python tools for Visual Studio extension that provides a full IDE for working with R or Python. We also provide other IDEs as well such as [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com) and [PyCharm Community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) on the VM. 

### Python
For development using Python, Anaconda Python distribution 2.7 and 3.6 has been installed. This distribution contains the base Python along with about 300 of the most popular math, engineering, and data analytics packages. You can use Python Tools for Visual Studio (PTVS) that is installed within the Visual Studio 2017 Community edition or one of the IDEs bundled with Anaconda like IDLE or Spyder. You can launch one of these by searching on the search bar (**Win** + **S** key).

> [!NOTE]
> To point the Python Tools for Visual Studio at Anaconda Python 2.7, you need to create custom environments for each version. To set these environment paths in the Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition, navigate to **Tools** -> **Python Tools** -> **Python Environments** and then click **+ Custom**. 
> 
> 

Anaconda Python 3.6 is installed under C:\Anaconda and Anaconda Python 2.7 is installed under c:\Anaconda\envs\python2. See [PTVS documentation](/visualstudio/python/installing-python-interpreters.md) for detailed steps. 

### Jupyter Notebook
Anaconda distribution also comes with a Jupyter notebook, an environment to share code and analysis. A Jupyter notebook server has been pre-configured with Python 2.7, Python 3.x, PySpark, Julia and R kernels. There is a desktop icon named "Jupyter Notebook" to start the Jupyter server and launch the browser to access the Notebook server. 

We have packaged several sample notebooks in Python and in R. The Jupyter notebooks show how to work with Microsoft ML Server, SQL Server ML Services (In-database analytics), Python, Microsoft Cognitive ToolKit, Tensorflow and other Azure technologies once you access Jupyter. You can see the link to the samples on the notebook home page after you authenticate to the Jupyter notebook using the password you created in an earlier step. 

### Visual Studio 2017 Community edition
Visual Studio Community edition installed on the VM. It is a free version of the popular IDE from Microsoft that you can use for evaluation purposes and for small teams. You can check out the licensing terms [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/support/legal/mt171547).  Open Visual Studio by double-clicking the desktop icon or the **Start** menu. You can also search for programs with **Win** + **S** and entering “Visual Studio”. Once there you can create projects in languages like C#, Python, R, node.js. Plugins are also installed that make it convenient to work with Azure services like Azure Data Catalog, Azure HDInsight (Hadoop, Spark), and Azure Data Lake. Now there is also a plugin called ```Visual Studio Tools for AI``` that seamlessly integrates to Azure Machine Learning and helps you rapidly build AI applications. 

> [!NOTE]
> You may get a message stating that your evaluation period has expired. Enter your Microsoft account credentials or create a new free account to get access to the Visual Studio Community Edition. 
> 
> 

### SQL Server 2017 Developer edition
A developer version of SQL Server 2017 with ML Services to run in-database analytics is provided on the VM in either R or Python. ML Services provide a platform for developing and deploying intelligent applications. You can use the rich and powerful these languages and the many packages from the community to create models and generate predictions for your SQL Server data. You can keep analytics close to the data because ML Services (In-database) integrates both the R and Python language within the SQL Server. This eliminates the costs and security risks associated with data movement.

> [!NOTE]
> The SQL Server developer edition can only be used for development and test purposes. You need a license to run it in production. 
> 
> 

You can access the SQL server by launching **SQL Server Management Studio**. Your VM name is populated as the Server Name. Use Windows Authentication when logged in as the admin on Windows. Once you are in SQL Server Management Studio you can create other users, create databases, import data, and run SQL queries. 

To enable In-database analytics using SQL ML Services, run the following command as a one time action in SQL Server management studio after logging in as the server administrator. 

        CREATE LOGIN [%COMPUTERNAME%\SQLRUserGroup] FROM WINDOWS 

        (Please replace the %COMPUTERNAME% with your VM name)


### Azure
