# Python packages for Azure Machine Learning

Learn about the proprietary Python packages from Microsoft for Azure Machine Learning. You can use these libraries and functions in combination with other open-source or third-party packages, but to use the proprietary packages, your Python code must run against a service or on a computer that provides the interpreters.

The Azure Machine Learning packages are **Python pip-installable extensions for Azure Machine Learning** that enable data scientists and AI developers to quickly build and deploy highly accurate machine learning and deep learning models for various domains.

## amlrealtimeai (FPGA acceleration)

With Azure Machine Learning Hardware Acceleration package, data scientists and AI developers can featurize images with a quantized version of ResNet 50, train classifiers based on those features, and then deploy models to an [field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)](concept-accelerate-with-fpgas.md) on Azure for ultra-low latency inferencing.

Try these next steps for this package:
1. [Download](https://aka.ms/aml-real-time-ai-package) the package.
1. Read the [install docs](reference-fpga-package-overview.md).
1. [Deploy a model to an FPGA](how-to-deploy-fpga-web-service.md).
