# Quickstart: Install and get started with Azure Machine Learning services
Azure Machine Learning services (preview) are an integrated, end-to-end data science and advanced analytics solution. It helps professional data scientists prepare data, develop experiments, and deploy models at cloud scale.

This quickstart shows you how to:

* Create service accounts for Azure Machine Learning services
* Install and log in to Azure Machine Learning Workbench.
* Create a project in Workbench
* Run a script in that project  
* Access the command-line interface (CLI)


As part of the Microsoft Azure portfolio, Azure Machine Learning services require an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

Additionally, you must have adequate permissions to create assets such as Resource Groups, Virtual Machines, and so on. 

<a name="prerequisites"></a>You can install the Azure Machine Learning Workbench application on the following operating systems:
- Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016
- macOS Sierra or High Sierra

## Create Azure Machine Learning services accounts
Use the Azure portal to provision your Azure Machine Learning accounts: 
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) using the credentials for the Azure subscription you'll use. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) now.

## Install and log in to Workbench

Azure Machine Learning Workbench is available for Windows or macOS. See the list of [supported platforms](#prerequisites).

>[!WARNING]
>The installation might take around 30 minutes to complete. 

1. Download and launch the latest Workbench installer. 
   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >Download the installer fully on disk, and then run it from there. Do not run it directly from your browser's download widget.

   **On Windows:** 

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Download [AmlWorkbenchSetup.msi](https://aka.ms/azureml-wb-msi).  <br/>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Double-click on the downloaded installer in File Explorer.

   **On macOS:** 

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Download [AmlWorkbench.dmg](https://aka.ms/azureml-wb-dmg). <br/>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Double-click on the downloaded installer in Finder.<br/><br/>

1. Follow the on-screen instructions in your installer to completion. 

   **The installation might take around 30 minutes to complete.**  
   
   | |Installation path to Azure Machine Learning Workbench|
   |--------|------------------------------------------------|
   |Windows|C:\Users\\<user\>\AppData\Local\AmlWorkbench|
   |macOS|/Applications/Azure ML Workbench.app|

   The installer will download and set up all the necessary dependencies, such as Python, Miniconda, and other related libraries. This installation also includes the Azure cross-platform command-line tool, or Azure CLI.

1. Launch Workbench by selecting the **Launch Workbench** button on the last screen of the installer. 

   If you closed the installer:
   + On Windows, launch it using the **Machine Learning Workbench** desktop shortcut. 
   + On macOS, select **Azure ML Workbench** in Launchpad.

1. On the first screen, select **Sign in with Microsoft** to authenticate with the Azure Machine Learning Workbench. Use the same credentials you used in the Azure portal to create the Experimentation and Model Management accounts. 

   Once you are signed in, Workbench uses the first Experimentation account it finds in your Azure subscriptions, and displays all workspaces and projects associated with that account. 

   >[!TIP]
   > You can switch to a different Experimentation account using the icon in the lower-left corner of the Workbench application window.

## Create a project in Workbench

In Azure Machine Learning, a project is the logical container for all the work being done to solve a problem. It maps to a single folder on your local disk, and you can add any files or subfolders to it. 

Here, we are creating a new Workbench project using a template that includes the [Iris flower dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). The tutorials that follow this quickstart depend on this data to build a model that predicts the type of iris based on some of its physical characteristics.  

1. With Azure Machine Learning Workbench open, select the plus sign (+) in the **PROJECTS** pane and choose **New Project**.  

   ![New workspace](./media/quickstart-installation/new_ws.png)

1. Fill out of the form fields and select the **Create** button to create a new project in the Workbench.

   Field|Suggested value for tutorial|Description
   ---|---|---
   Project name | myIris |Enter a unique name that identifies your account. You can use your own name, or a departmental or project name that best identifies the experiment. The name should be 2 to 32 characters. It should include only alphanumeric characters and the dash (-) character. 
   Project directory | c:\Temp\ | Specify the directory in which the project is created.
   Project description | _leave blank_ | Optional field useful for describing the projects.
   Visualstudio.com GIT Repository URL |_leave blank_ | Optional field. A project can optionally be associated with a Git repository on Visual Studio Team Services for source control and collaboration. [Learn how to set that up.](../desktop-workbench/using-git-ml-project.md#step-3-set-up-a-machine-learning-project-and-git-repo). 
   Selected workspace | IrisGarden (if it exists) | Choose a workspace that you have created for your Experimentation account in the Azure portal. <br/>If you followed the Quickstart, you should have a workspace by the name IrisGarden. If not, select the one you created when you created your Experimentation account or any other you want to use.
   Project template | Classifying Iris | Templates contain scripts and data you can use to explore the product. This template contains the scripts and data you need for this quickstart and other tutorials in this documentation site. 

   ![New project](./media/quickstart-installation/new_project.png)
 
 A new project is created and the project dashboard opens with that project. At this point, you can explore the project home page, data sources, notebooks, and source code files. 

>[!TIP]
>You can configure Workbench to work with a Python IDE for a smooth data science development experience. Then, you can interact with your project in the IDE. [Learn how](../desktop-workbench/how-to-configure-your-ide.md). 

## Run a Python script

Now, you can run the **iris_sklearn.py** script on your local computer. This script is included by default with the **Classifying Iris** project template. The script builds a [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) model using the popular Python [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) library.

1. In the command bar at the top of the **Project Dashboard** page, select **local** as the execution target and select **iris_sklearn.py** as the script to run. These values are preselected by default. 

   There are other files included in the sample that you can check out later, but for this quickstart we are only interested in **iris_sklearn.py**. 

   ![Command bar](./media/quickstart-installation/run_control.png)

1. In the **Arguments** text box, enter **0.01**. This number corresponds to the regularization rate, and is used in the script to configure the logistic regression model. 

1. Select **Run** to start the execution of the script on your computer. The **iris_sklearn.py** job immediately appears in the **Jobs** panel on the right so you can monitor the script's execution.

   Congratulations! You've successfully run a Python script in Azure Machine Learning Workbench.

1. Repeat steps 2 - 3 several times using different argument values ranging from **0.001** to **10** (for example, using powers of 10). Each run appears in the **Jobs** pane.

1. Inspect the run history by selecting the **Runs** view and then **iris_sklearn.py** in the Runs list. 

   ![Run history dashboard](./media/quickstart-installation/run_view.png)

   This view shows every run that was executed on **iris_sklearn.py**. The run history dashboard also displays the top metrics, a set of default graphs, and a list of metrics for each run. 

1. You can customize this view by sorting, filtering, and adjusting the configurations using the gear and filter icons.

   ![Metrics and graphs](./media/quickstart-installation/run_dashboard.png)

3. Select a completed run in the Jobs pane to see a detailed view for that specific execution. Details include additional metrics, the files that it produced, and other potentially useful logs.

## Start the CLI

The Azure Machine Learning command-line interface (CLI) is also installed. The CLI interface allows you to access and interact with your Azure Machine Learning services using the `az` commands to perform all tasks required for an end-to-end data science workflow. [Learn more.](../desktop-workbench/tutorial-iris-azure-cli.md)

You can launch the Azure Machine Learning CLI from the Workbench's toolbar using **File → Open Command Prompt**.

You can get help on commands in the Azure Machine Learning CLI using the --help argument.

```az ml --help```
