# Track progress of data science projects

Data science group managers, team leads, and project leads need to track the progress of their team projects, what work has been done on them and by whom, and remains on the to-do lists. 

## VSTS dashboards
If you are using Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), you are able to build dashboards to track the activities and the work items associated with a given Agile project. 

For more information on how to create and customize dashboards and widgets on Visual Studio Team Services, see the following sets of instructions:

- [Add and manage dashboards](https://docs.microsoft.com/vsts/report/dashboards/dashboards)
- [Add widgets to a dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/vsts/report/dashboards/add-widget-to-dashboard).

## Example dashboard

Here is a simple example dashboard that is built to track the sprint activities of an Agile data science project, as well as the number of commits to associated repositories. The **top left** panel shows:

- the countdown of the current sprint, 
- the number of commits for each repository in the last 7 days
- the work item for specific users. 

The remaining panels show the cumulative flow diagram (CFD), burndown, and burnup for a project:

- **Bottom left**:  CFD the quantity of work in a given state, showing approved in gray, committed in blue, and done in green.
- **Top right**: burndown chart the work left to complete versus the time remaining).
- **Bottom right**: burnup chart the work that has been completed versus the total amount of work.

For a description of how to build these charts, see  the quickstarts and tutorials at [Dashboards](https://docs.microsoft.com/vsts/report/dashboards/).
 
## Next steps

Walkthroughs that demonstrate all the steps in the process for **specific scenarios** are also provided. They are listed and linked with thumbnail descriptions in the [Example walkthroughs](walkthroughs.md) article. They illustrate how to combine cloud, on-premises tools, and services into a workflow or pipeline to create an intelligent application.
