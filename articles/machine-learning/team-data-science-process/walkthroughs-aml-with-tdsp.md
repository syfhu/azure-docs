# Team Data Science structured projects in Azure Machine Learning Workbench

These tutorials and samples show how to create Team Data Science structured projects with Azure Machine Learning Workbench. For an overview of the Team Data Science Process, see [Data Science Process](overview.md). For an overview of Spark on HDInsight, see [Introduction to Spark on HDInsight](../../hdinsight/spark/apache-spark-overview.md).

Additional data science walkthroughs that execute the Team Data Science Process are grouped by the **platform** that they use. See [Walkthroughs executing the Team Data Science Process](walkthroughs.md) for an itemization of these examples.

## Classify UCI incomes in Azure Machine Learning Workbench

For a tutorial showing how create a TDSP project in Azure Machine Learning Workbench, see [Team Data Science Process Tutorial: Classify UCI incomes in Azure Machine Learning Workbench](../desktop-workbench/scenario-tdsp-classifying-us-incomes.md) 


## Biomedical entity recognition using Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

For a sample that uses a TDSP-instantiated project in Azure Machine Learning Workbench, see [Biomedical entity recognition using Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](../desktop-workbench/scenario-tdsp-biomedical-recognition.md)

## Next steps

For a discussion of the key components that comprise the Team Data Science Process, see [Team Data Science Process overview](overview.md).

For a discussion of the Team Data Science Process lifecycle that you can use to structure your data science projects, see [Team Data Science Process lifecycle](lifecycle.md). The lifecycle outlines the steps, from start to finish, that projects usually follow when they are executed.
