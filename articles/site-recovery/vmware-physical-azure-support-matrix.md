# Support matrix for VMware and physical server replication to Azure

This article summarizes supported components and settings for disaster recovery of VMware VMs to Azure by using [Azure Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md).

## Replication scenario

**Scenario** | **Details**
--- | ---
VMware VMs | Replication of on-premises VMware VMs to Azure. You can deploy this scenario in the Azure portal or by using [PowerShell](vmware-azure-disaster-recovery-powershell.md).
Physical servers | Replication of on-premises Windows/Linux physical serversto Azure. You can deploy this scenario in the Azure portal.

## On-premises virtualization servers

**Server** | **Requirements** | **Details**
--- | --- | ---
VMware | vCenter Server 6.5, 6.0, or 5.5 or vSphere 6.5, 6.0, or 5.5 | We recommend that you use a vCenter server.<br/><br/> We recommend that vSphere hosts and vCenter servers are located in the same network as the process server. By default the process server components runs on the configuration server, so this will be the network in which you set up the configuration server, unless you set up a dedicated process server.
Physical | N/A

## Site Recovery configuration server

The configuration server is an on-premises machine that runs Site Recovery components, including the configuration server, process server, and master target server. For VMware replication you set the configuration server up with all requirements, using an OVF template to create a VMware VM. For physical server replication, you set the configuration server machine up manually.

**Component** | **Requirements**
--- |---
CPU cores | 8
RAM | 16 GB
Number of disks | 3 disks<br/><br/> Disks include the OS disk, process server cache disk, and retention drive for failback.
Disk free space | 600 GB of space required for process server cache.
Disk free space | 600 GB  of space required for retention drive.
Operating system  | Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016 |
Operating system locale | English (en-us)
PowerCLI | [PowerCLI 6.0](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?productId=491&downloadGroup=PCLI600R1 "PowerCLI 6.0") should be installed.
Windows Server roles | Don't enable: <br> - Active Directory Domain Services <br>- Internet Information Services <br> - Hyper-V |
Group policies| Don't enable: <br> - Prevent access to the command prompt. <br> - Prevent access to registry editing tools. <br> - Trust logic for file attachments. <br> - Turn on Script Execution. <br> [Learn more](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg176671(v=ws.10).aspx)|
IIS | Make sure you:<br/><br/> - Don't have a preexisting default website <br> - Enable  [anonymous authentication](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc731244(v=ws.10).aspx) <br> - Enable [FastCGI](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc753077(v=ws.10).aspx) setting  <br> - Don't have preexisting website/app listening on port 443<br>
NIC type | VMXNET3 (when deployed as a VMware VM)
IP address type | Static
Ports | 443 used for control channel orchestration)<br>9443 used for data transport

## Replicated machines

Site Recovery supports replication of any workload running on a supported machine.

**Component** | **Details**
--- | ---
Machine settings | Machines that replicate to Azure must meet [Azure requirements](#azure-vm-requirements).
Windows operating system | 64-bit Windows Server 2016 (Server Core, Server with Desktop Experience), Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2 with at least SP1. Windows 2016 Nano Server isn't supported.
Linux operating system | Red Hat Enterprise Linux: 5.2 to 5.11, 6.1 to 6.9, 7.0 to 7.4 <br/><br/>CentOS: 5.2 to 5.11, 6.1 to 6.9, 7.0 to 7.4 <br/><br/>Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server[ (supported kernel versions)](#ubuntu-kernel-versions)<br/><br/>Ubuntu 16.04 LTS server[ (supported kernel versions)](#ubuntu-kernel-versions)<br/><br/>Debian 7/Debian 8[ (supported kernel versions)](#debian-kernel-versions)<br/><br/>Oracle Enterprise Linux 6.4, 6.5 running the Red Hat compatible kernel or Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel Release 3 (UEK3) <br/><br/>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP4 <br/><br/>Upgrading replicated machines from SP3 to SP4 isn't supported. To upgrade, disable replication and enable it again after the upgrade.

>[!NOTE]
>
> - On Linux distributions, only the stock kernels that are part of the distribution minor version release/update are supported.
>
> - Upgrading protected machines across major Linux distribution versions isn't supported. To upgrade, disable replication, upgrade the operating system, and then enable replication again.
