# Prepare the target environment for VMware replication to Azure

This article describes how to prepare your target Azure environment to start replicating VMware virtual machines to Azure.

## Prerequisites

The article assumes:
- You have created a Recovery Services Vault to protect your VMware virtual machines. You can create a Recovery Services Vault from the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com "Azure portal").
- You have [setup your on-premises environment](vmware-azure-set-up-source.md) to replicate VMware virtual machines to Azure.

## Prepare target

After completing the **Step 1:Select Protection goal** and **Step 2:Prepare Source**, you are taken to **Step 3: Target**

1. **Subscription:** From the drop-down menu, select the Subscription that you want to replicate your virtual machines to.
2. **Deployment Model:** Select the deployment model (Classic or Resource Manager)

Based on the chosen deployment model, a validation is run to ensure that you have at least one compatible storage account and virtual network in the target subscription to replicate and failover your virtual machine to.

Once the validations complete successfully, click OK to go to the next step.

If you don't have a compatible Resource Manager storage account or virtual network, you can create on by clicking the **+ Storage Account** or **+ Network** buttons at the top of the page.

## Next steps
[Configure replication settings](vmware-azure-set-up-replication.md).
