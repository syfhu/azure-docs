# Migrate SQL Server to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance using DMS
You can use the Azure Database Migration Service to migrate the databases from an on-premises SQL Server instance to an [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](../sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance.md). For additional methods that may require some manual effort, see the article [SQL Server instance migration to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](../sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-migrate.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Migration projects from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance are in preview and subject to the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

In this tutorial, you migrate the **Adventureworks2012** database from an on-premises instance of SQL Server to an Azure SQL Database Managed Instance by using the Azure Database Migration Service.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an instance of the Azure Database Migration Service.
> * Create a migration project by using the Azure Database Migration Service.
> * Run the migration.
> * Monitor the migration.
> * Download a migration report.

## Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you need to:

- Create a VNET for the Azure Database Migration Service by using the Azure Resource Manager deployment model, which provides site-to-site connectivity to your on-premises source servers by using either [ExpressRoute](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) or [VPN](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways). [Learn network topologies for Azure SQL DB Managed Instance migrations using the Azure Database Migration Service](https://aka.ms/dmsnetworkformi).
- Ensure that your Azure Virtual Network (VNET) Network Security Group rules do not block the following communication ports 443, 53, 9354, 445, 12000. For more detail on Azure VNET NSG traffic filtering, see the article [Filter network traffic with network security groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg).
- Configure your [Windows Firewall for source database engine access](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-a-windows-firewall-for-database-engine-access).
- Open your Windows Firewall to allow the Azure Database Migration Service to access the source SQL Server, which by default is TCP port 1433.
- If you are running multiple named SQL Server instances using dynamic ports, you may wish to enable the SQL Browser Service and allow access to UDP port 1434 through your firewalls so that the Azure Database Migration Service can connect to a named instance on your source server.
- If you are using a firewall appliance in front of your source databases, you may need to add firewall rules to allow the Azure Database Migration Service to access the source database(s) for migration, as well as files via SMB port 445.
- Create an Azure SQL Database Managed Instance by following the detail in the article [Create an Azure SQL Database Managed Instance in the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/sqldbmi).
- Ensure that the logins used to connect the source SQL Server and target Managed Instance are members of the sysadmin server role.
- Create a network share that the Azure Database Migration Service can use to back up the source database.
- Ensure that the service account running the source SQL Server instance has write privileges on the network share that you created and that the computer account for the source server has read/write access to the same share.
- Make a note of a Windows user (and password) that has full control privilege on the network share that you previously created. The Azure Database Migration Service impersonates the user credential to upload the backup files to Azure storage container for restore operation.
- Create a blob container and retrieve its SAS URI by using the steps in the article [Manage Azure Blob Storage resources with Storage Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-blobs#get-the-sas-for-a-blob-container), be sure to select all permissions (Read, Write, Delete, List) on the policy window while creating the SAS URI. This detail provides the Azure Database Migration Service with access to your storage account container for uploading the backup files used for migrating databases to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance

## Register the Microsoft.DataMigration resource provider

1. Log in to the Azure portal, select **All services**, and then select **Subscriptions**.

    ![Show portal subscriptions](media\tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance\portal-select-subscriptions.png)

    ![Show resource providers](media\tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance\portal-select-resource-provider.png)

3. Search for migration, and then to the right of **Microsoft.DataMigration**, select **Register**.

    ![Register resource provider](media\tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance\portal-register-resource-provider.png)   

## Create an Azure Database Migration Service instance

1. In the Azure portal, select + **Create a resource**, search for **Azure Database Migration Service**, and then select **Azure Database Migration Service** from the drop-down list.

     ![Azure Marketplace](media\tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance\portal-marketplace.png)

2. On the **Azure Database Migration Service** screen, select **Create**.

    ![Create Azure Database Migration Service instance](media\tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance\dms-create1.png)

3. On the **Create Migration Service** screen, specify a name for the service, the subscription, and a new or existing resource group.

4. Select an existing virtual network (VNET) or create one.
 
    The VNET provides the Azure Database Migration Service with access to the source SQL Server and target Azure SQL Database Managed Instance.

    For more information on how to create a VNET in Azure portal, see the article [Create a virtual network using the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/DMSVnet).

    For additional detail, see the article [Network topologies for Azure SQL DB Managed Instance migrations using the Azure Database Migration Service](https://aka.ms/dmsnetworkformi).

5. Select a pricing tier.

    For more information on costs and pricing tiers, see the [pricing page](https://aka.ms/dms-pricing).
   
    ![Create DMS Service](media\tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance\dms-create-service1.png)

6.  Select **Create** to create the service.

## Create a migration project

After the service is created, locate it within the Azure portal, open it, and then create a new migration project.

1. In the Azure portal, select **All services**, search for Azure Database Migration Service, and then select **Azure Database Migration Services**.

    ![Locate all instances of the Azure Database Migration Service](media\tutorial-sql-server-to-azure-sql\dms-search.png)

2. On the **Azure Database Migration Service screen**, search for the name of the instance that you created, and then select the instance.
 
3. Select + **New Migration Project**.

4. On the **New migration project** screen, specify a name for the project, in the **Source server type** text box, select **SQL Server**, and then in the **Target server type** text box, select **Azure SQL Database Managed Instance**.

   ![Create DMS Project](media\tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance\dms-create-project1.png)

5. Select **Create** to create the project.

## Specify source details

1. On the **Source details** screen, specify the connection details for the source SQL Server.

2. If you have not installed a trusted certificate on your server, select the **Trust server certificate** check box.

    When a trusted certificate is not installed, SQL Server generates a self-signed certificate when the instance is started. This certificate is used to encrypt the credentials for client connections.

    > [!CAUTION]
    > SSL connections that are encrypted using a self-signed certificate does not provide strong security. They are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. You should not rely on SSL using self-signed certificates in a production environment or on servers that are connected to the internet.
