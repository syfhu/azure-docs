# Deploy a container group

Azure Container Instances supports the deployment of multiple containers onto a single host using a [container group](container-instances-container-groups.md). This is useful when building an application sidecar for logging, monitoring, or any other configuration where a service needs a second attached process.

There are two methods for deploying multi-container groups using the Azure CLI:

* Resource Manager template deployment (this article)
* [YAML file deployment](container-instances-multi-container-yaml.md)

Deployment with a Resource Manager template is recommended when you need to deploy additional Azure service resources (for example, an Azure Files share) at the time of container instance deployment. Due to the YAML format's more concise nature, deployment with a YAML file is recommended when your deployment includes *only* container instances.

> [!NOTE]
> Multi-container groups are currently restricted to Linux containers. While we are working to bring all features to Windows containers, you can find current platform differences in [Quotas and region availability for Azure Container Instances](container-instances-quotas.md).

## Configure the template

The sections in this article walk you through running a simple multi-container sidecar configuration by deploying an Azure Resource Manager template.

Start by creating a file named `azuredeploy.json`, then copy the following JSON into it.

This Resource Manager template defines a container group with two containers, a public IP address, and two exposed ports. The first container in the group runs an internet-facing application. The second container, the sidecar, makes an HTTP request to the main web application via the group's local network.

```JSON

  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",

      "type": "string",

        "description": "Container Group name."
      }
    }
  },

      "properties": {
        "containers": [
          {
            "name": "[variables('container1name')]",
            "properties": {
              "image": "[variables('container1image')]",
              "resources": {
                "requests": {
                  "cpu": 1,
                  "memoryInGb": 1.5
                }
              },
              "ports": [
                {
                  "port": 80
                },
                {
                  "port": 8080
                }
              ]
            }
          },

                }
              }
            }
          }
        ],

            {
              "protocol": "tcp",
              "port": "80"
            },
            {
                "protocol": "tcp",
                "port": "8080"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "outputs": {
    "containerIPv4Address": {
      "type": "string",
      "value": "[reference(resourceId('Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups/', parameters('containerGroupName'))).ipAddress.ip]"
    }
  }
}
```

To use a private container image registry, add an object to the JSON document with the following format. For an example implementation of this configuration, see the [ACI Resource Manager template reference][template-reference] documentation.

```JSON
"imageRegistryCredentials": [
  {
    "server": "[parameters('imageRegistryLoginServer')]",
    "username": "[parameters('imageRegistryUsername')]",
    "password": "[parameters('imageRegistryPassword')]"
  }
]
```

## Deploy the template

Create a resource group with the [az group create][az-group-create] command.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

Deploy the template with the [az group deployment create][az-group-deployment-create] command.

```azurecli-interactive
az group deployment create --resource-group myResourceGroup --template-file azuredeploy.json
```

Within a few seconds, you should receive an initial response from Azure.

## View deployment state

To view the state of the deployment, use the following [az container show][az-container-show] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az container show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myContainerGroup --output table
```

If you'd like to view the running application, navigate to its IP address in your browser. For example, the IP is `52.168.26.124` in this example output:

```bash
Name              ResourceGroup    ProvisioningState    Image                                                           IP:ports               CPU/Memory       OsType    Location
----------------  ---------------  -------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------  ---------------  --------  ----------
myContainerGroup  myResourceGroup  Succeeded            microsoft/aci-helloworld:latest,microsoft/aci-tutorial-sidecar  52.168.26.124:80,8080  1.0 core/1.5 gb  Linux     westus
```

## View logs

View the log output of a container using the [az container logs][az-container-logs] command. The `--container-name` argument specifies the container from which to pull logs. In this example, the first container is specified.

```azurecli-interactive
az container logs --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myContainerGroup --container-name aci-tutorial-app
```

Output:

```bash
listening on port 80
::1 - - [09/Jan/2018:23:17:48 +0000] "HEAD / HTTP/1.1" 200 1663 "-" "curl/7.54.0"
::1 - - [09/Jan/2018:23:17:51 +0000] "HEAD / HTTP/1.1" 200 1663 "-" "curl/7.54.0"
::1 - - [09/Jan/2018:23:17:54 +0000] "HEAD / HTTP/1.1" 200 1663 "-" "curl/7.54.0"
```

To see the logs for the side-car container, run the same command specifying the second container name.

```azurecli-interactive
az container logs --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myContainerGroup --container-name aci-tutorial-sidecar
```

Output:

```bash
Every 3s: curl -I http://localhost                          2018-01-09 23:25:11

  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  0  1663    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0

```

As you can see, the sidecar is periodically making an HTTP request to the main web application via the group's local network to ensure that it is running. This sidecar example could be expanded to trigger an alert if it received an HTTP response code other than 200 OK.
