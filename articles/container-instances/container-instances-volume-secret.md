# Mount a secret volume in Azure Container Instances

Learn how to mount a *secret* volume in your container instances for the storage and retrieval of sensitive information by the containers in your container groups.

> [!NOTE]
> Mounting a *secret* volume is currently restricted to Linux containers. Learn how to pass secure environment variables for both Windows and Linux containers in [Set environment variables](container-instances-environment-variables.md). While we are working to bring all features to Windows containers, you can find current platform differences in [Quotas and region availability for Azure Container Instances](container-instances-quotas.md).

## secret volume

You can use a *secret* volume to provide sensitive information to the containers in a container group. The *secret* volume stores your specified secrets in files within the volume, which the containers in your container group can then access. By using secrets in a *secret* volume, you can avoid placing sensitive data like SSH keys or database credentials in your application code.

All *secret* volumes are backed by [tmpfs][tmpfs], a RAM-backed filesystem; their contents are never written to non-volatile storage.

## Mount a secret volume

To mount a *secret* volume in a container instance, you must deploy using an [Azure Resource Manager template](/azure/templates/microsoft.containerinstance/containergroups).

First, populate the `volumes` array in the container group `properties` section of the template. Next, for each container in the container group in which you'd like to mount the *secret* volume, populate the `volumeMounts` array in the `properties` section of the container definition.

For example, the following Resource Manager template creates a container group consisting of a single container. The container mounts a *secret* volume consisting of two Base64-encoded secrets.

To see an example of container instance deployment with an Azure Resource Manager template, see [Deploy multi-container groups in Azure Container Instances](container-instances-multi-container-group.md).
