# Quotas and region availability for Azure Container Instances

All Azure services include certain default limits and quotas for resources and features. The following sections detail the default resource limits for several Azure Container Instances (ACI) resources, as well as the availability of the ACI service in Azure regions.

## Service quotas and limits

[!INCLUDE [container-instances-limits](../../includes/container-instances-limits.md)]

## Region availability

Azure Container Instances is available in the following regions with the specified CPU and memory limits.

| Location | OS | CPU | Memory (GB) |
| -------- | -- | :---: | :-----------: |
| West US, East US, West Europe, North Europe | Linux | 4 | 14 |
| West US 2, Southeast Asia | Linux | 2 | 7 |
| West US, East US, West Europe, North Europe | Windows | 4 | 14 |
| West US 2, Southeast Asia | Windows | 2 | 3.5 |

Container instances created within these resource limits are subject to availability within the deployment region. When a region is under heavy load, you may experience a failure when deploying instances. To mitigate such a deployment failure, try deploying instances with lower CPU and memory settings, or try your deployment at a later time.

Let the team know of additional regions required or increased CPU/Memory limits at [aka.ms/aci/feedback](https://aka.ms/aci/feedback).

For more information on troubleshooting container instance deployment, see [Troubleshoot deployment issues with Azure Container Instances](container-instances-troubleshooting.md).

## Next steps

Certain default limits and quotas can be increased. To request an increase of one or more resources that support such an increase, please submit an [Azure support request][azure-support] (select "Quota" for **Issue type**).
