# Quickstart: Build a Table API app with .NET and Azure Cosmos DB 

This quickstart shows how to use .NET and the Azure Cosmos DB [Table API](table-introduction.md) to build an app by cloning an example from GitHub. This quickstart also shows you how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account and how to use Data Explorer to create tables and entities in the web-based Azure portal.

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed multi-model database service. You can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases, all of which benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB. 

## Prerequisites

If you don’t already have Visual Studio 2017 installed, you can download and use the **free** [Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). Make sure that you enable **Azure development** during the Visual Studio setup.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Create a database account

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> You must create a new Table API account to work with the generally available Table API SDKs. Table API accounts created during preview are not supported by the generally available SDKs.
>

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-table](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-table.md)]

## Add a table

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-table](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-table.md)]

## Add sample data

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-table-add-sample-data](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-table-add-sample-data.md)]

## Clone the sample application

Now let's clone a Table app from GitHub, set the connection string, and run it. You'll see how easy it is to work with data programmatically. 

1. Open a command prompt, create a new folder named git-samples, then close the command prompt.

    ```bash
    md "C:\git-samples"
    ```

2. Open a git terminal window, such as git bash, and use the `cd` command to change to the new folder to install the sample app.

    ```bash
    cd "C:\git-samples"
    ```

3. Run the following command to clone the sample repository. This command creates a copy of the sample app on your computer.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/storage-table-dotnet-getting-started.git
    ```
## Open the sample application in Visual Studio

1. In Visual Studio, from the **File** menu, choose **Open**, then choose **Project/Solution**. 

   ![Open the solution](media/create-table-dotnet/azure-cosmosdb-open-solution.png) 

2. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the sample application, and open the TableStorage.sln file.

   ![Open the cloned application](media/create-table-dotnet/azure-cosmos-db-open-clone.png) 

## Update your connection string

Now go back to the Azure portal to get your connection string information and copy it into the app. This enables your app to communicate with your hosted database. 

1. In the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/), click **Connection String**. 

    Use the copy button on the right side of the window to copy the **PRIMARY CONNECTION STRING**.

    ![View and copy the PRIMARY CONNECTION STRING in the Connection String pane](./media/create-table-dotnet/connection-string.png)

2. In Visual Studio, open the App.config file. 

3. Uncomment the StorageConnectionString on line 8 and comment out the StorageConnectionString on line 7, because this tutorial does not use the Azure SDK Storage Emulator. Lines 7 and 8 should now look like this:

    ```
    <!--key="StorageConnectionString" value="UseDevelopmentStorage=true;" />-->
    <add key="StorageConnectionString" value="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=[AccountName];AccountKey=[AccountKey]" />
    ```

4. Paste the **PRIMARY CONNECTION STRING** from the portal into the StorageConnectionString value on line 8. Paste the string inside the quotes. 

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If your Endpoint uses documents.azure.com, that means you have a preview account, and you must create a [new Table API account](#create-a-database-account) to work with the generally available Table API SDK. 
    > 

    Line 8 should now appear similar to:

    ```
    <add key="StorageConnectionString" value="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<account name>;AccountKey=<account-key>;TableEndpoint=https://<account name>.table.cosmosdb.azure.com;" />
    ```

5. Press CTRL+S to save the App.config file.

You've now updated your app with all the info it needs to communicate with Azure Cosmos DB. 

## Build and deploy the app

1. In Visual Studio, right-click on the **TableStorage** project in **Solution Explorer** and then click **Manage NuGet Packages**. 

   ![Manage NuGet Packages](media/create-table-dotnet/azure-cosmosdb-manage-nuget.png)
2. In the NuGet **Browse** box, type *Microsoft.Azure.CosmosDB.Table*. This will find the Cosmos DB Table API client library.
   
   ![NuGet Browse tab](media/create-table-dotnet/azure-cosmosdb-nuget-browse.png)

3. Click **Install** to install the **Microsoft.Azure.CosmosDB.Table** library. This installs the Azure Cosmos DB Table API package and all dependencies.

    ![Click Install](media/create-table-dotnet/azure-cosmosdb-nuget-install.png)

4. Open BasicSamples.cs. Right-click on line 52, select **Breakpoint**, then select **Insert Breakpoint**. Insert another breakpoint on line 55.

   ![Add a breakpoint](media/create-table-dotnet/azure-cosmosdb-breakpoint.png) 

5. Press F5 to run the application.

    The console window displays the name of the new table database (in this case, demo91ab4) in Azure Cosmos DB. 
    
    ![Console output](media/create-table-dotnet/azure-cosmosdb-console.png)

    If you get an error about dependencies, see [Troubleshooting](table-sdk-dotnet.md#troubleshooting).

    When you hit the first breakpoint, go back to Data Explorer in the Azure portal. Click the **Refresh** button, expand the demo* table, and click **Entities**. The **Entities** tab on the right shows the new entity that was added for Walter Harp. Note that the phone number for the new entity is 425-555-0101.

    ![New entity](media/create-table-dotnet/azure-cosmosdb-entity.png)
    
6. Close the **Entities** tab in Data Explorer.
    
7. Press F5 to run the app to the next breakpoint. 

    When you hit the breakpoint, switch back to the Azure portal, click **Entities** again to open the **Entities** tab, and note that the phone number has been updated to 425-555-0105.

8. Press F5 to run the app. 
 
   The app adds entities for use in an advanced sample app that the Table API currently does not support. The app then deletes the table created by the sample app.

9. In the console window, press Enter to end the execution of the app.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you've learned how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account, create a table using the Data Explorer, and run an app.  Now you can query your data using the Table API.
