## Release notes

### v2 builds

### <a name="2.0.4"/>2.0.4
* GA SDK

### <a name="2.0.3-prerelease"/>2.0.3-prerelease
* Fixed the following issues:
  * When partition split happens, there could be duplicate processing of documents modified before the split.
  * The GetEstimatedRemainingWork API returned 0 when no leases were present in the lease collection.

* The following exceptions are made public. Extensions that implement IPartitionProcessor can throw these exceptions.
  * Microsoft.Azure.Documents.ChangeFeedProcessor.Exceptions.LeaseLostException. 
  * Microsoft.Azure.Documents.ChangeFeedProcessor.Exceptions.PartitionException. 
  * Microsoft.Azure.Documents.ChangeFeedProcessor.Exceptions.PartitionNotFoundException.
  * Microsoft.Azure.Documents.ChangeFeedProcessor.Exceptions.PartitionSplitException. 

### <a name="2.0.2-prerelease"/>2.0.2-prerelease
* Minor API changes:
  * Removed ChangeFeedProcessorOptions.IsAutoCheckpointEnabled that was marked as obsolete.

### <a name="2.0.1-prerelease"/>2.0.1-prerelease
* Stability improvements:
  * Better handling of lease store initialization. When lease store is empty, only one instance of processor can initialize it, the others will wait.
  * More stable/efficient lease renewal/release. Renewing and releasing a lease one partition is independent from renewing others. In v1 that was done sequentially for all partitions.
* New v2 API:
  * Builder pattern for flexible construction of the processor: the ChangeFeedProcessorBuilder class.
    * Can take any combination of parameters.
    * Can take DocumentClient instance for monitoring and/or lease collection (not available in v1).
  * IChangeFeedObserver.ProcessChangesAsync now takes CancellationToken.
  * IRemainingWorkEstimator - the remaining work estimator can be used separately from the processor.
  * New extensibility points:
    * IParitionLoadBalancingStrategy - for custom load-balancing of partitions between instances of the processor.
    * ILease, ILeaseManager - for custom lease management.
    * IPartitionProcessor - for custom processing changes on a partition.
* Logging - uses [LibLog](https://github.com/damianh/LibLog) library.
* 100% backward compatible with v1 API.
* New code base.
* Compatible with [SQL .NET SDK](sql-api-sdk-dotnet.md) versions 1.21.1 and above.

### v1 builds

### <a name="1.3.3"/>1.3.3
* Added more logging.
* Fixed a DocumentClient leak when calling the pending work estimation multiple times.

### <a name="1.3.2"/>1.3.2
* Fixes in the pending work estimation.

### <a name="1.3.1"/>1.3.1
* Stability improvements.
  * Fix for handling cancelled tasks issue that might lead to stopped observers on some partitions.
* Support for manual checkpointing.
* Compatible with [SQL .NET SDK](sql-api-sdk-dotnet.md) versions 1.21 and above.

### <a name="1.2.0"/>1.2.0
* Adds support for .NET Standard 2.0. The package now supports `netstandard2.0` and `net451` framework monikers.
* Compatible with [SQL .NET SDK](sql-api-sdk-dotnet.md) versions 1.17.0 and above.
* Compatible with [SQL .NET Core SDK](sql-api-sdk-dotnet-core.md) versions 1.5.1 and above.

### <a name="1.1.1"/>1.1.1
* Fixes an issue with the calculation of the estimate of remaining work when the Change Feed was empty or no work was pending.
* Compatible with [SQL .NET SDK](sql-api-sdk-dotnet.md) versions 1.13.2 and above.

### <a name="1.1.0"/>1.1.0
* Added a method to obtain an estimate of remaining work to be processed in the Change Feed.
* Compatible with [SQL .NET SDK](sql-api-sdk-dotnet.md) versions 1.13.2 and above.

### <a name="1.0.0"/>1.0.0
* GA SDK
* Compatible with [SQL .NET SDK](sql-api-sdk-dotnet.md) versions 1.14.1 and below.


## Release & Retirement dates
Microsoft will provide notification at least **12 months** in advance of retiring an SDK in order to smooth the transition to a newer/supported version.

New features and functionality and optimizations are only added to the current SDK, as such it is recommended that you always upgrade to the latest SDK version as early as possible. 

Any request to Cosmos DB using a retired SDK will be rejected by the service.
