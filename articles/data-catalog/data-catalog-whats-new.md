* Support for registering and discovering Azure SQL Data Warehouse objects and databases. For additional information on Azure SQL Data Warehouse, see [SQL Data Warehouse](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-data-warehouse/).
* Support for registering and discovering SQL Server Analysis Services models and SQL Server Reporting Services servers as containers. When registering SSAS and SSRS objects, Azure Data Catalog creates an entry for the SSAS model and SSRS server, and for the reports and other objects. The containers can be discovered and annotated using the Azure Data Catalog portal. Users can also search and filter the contents of a model or server in addition to searching and filtering the contents of the catalog.
* Support for registering and discovering SQL Server Analysis Services objects via HTTP/HTTPS. Users can now connect to SSAS servers using a URL (such as https://servername/olap/msmdpump.dll) rather than a server name, and can use Basic authentication and Anonymous connections in addition to Windows authentication. For additional information on HTTP/HTTPS connections to SSAS, see [Configure HTTP Access to Analysis Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/gg492140.aspx).

* Support for registering and discovering Oracle databases and HDFS clusters as containers. When registering Oracle tables and views or HDFS, Azure Data Catalog creates an entry for the database, tables, and views. The database can be discovered and annotated using the Azure Data Catalog portal. Users can also search and filter the contents of a database or cluster in addition to searching and filtering the contents of the catalog.
* Support for manually registering unknown data source types. Users can manually enter data source information using the Azure Data Catalog portal, so that data sources not explicitly supported by the data source registration tool can be annotated and discovered.
* Support for registering and discovering SQL Server databases as containers. When registering SQL Server tables and views, Azure Data Catalog creates an entry for the database, tables, and views. The database can be discovered and annotated using the Azure Data Catalog portal. Users can also search and filter the contents of a database in addition to searching and filtering the contents of the catalog.

> [!NOTE]
> SSAS and SSRS objects that have been registered prior to the September 18 release must be re-registered using the data source registration tool before the model or server entry is added to the catalog. Re-registering a data source does not affect any annotations that have been added by users in the Azure Data Catalog portal.

> [!NOTE]
> Oracle tables and views and HDFS files and directories that have been registered prior to the September 11 release must be re-registered using the data source registration tool before the database or cluster entry is added to the catalog. Re-registering a data source does not affect any annotations that have been added by users in the Azure Data Catalog portal.

> [!NOTE]
> SQL Server tables and views that have been registered prior to the September 4 release must be re-registered using the data source registration tool before the database entry is added to the catalog. Re-registering a data source does not affect any annotations that have been added by users in the Azure Data Catalog portal.

## What's new for August 2015
As of August 2015, the following capabilities have been added to Azure Data Catalog:

* Support for providing access request information for registered data sources. For any registered data asset, users can now provide instructions for requesting access, including email links or URLs, to easily integrate with existing tools and processes.
* Tool tips for tags and experts, to make it easier to discover what users have provided what metadata for registered data assets.
* We’ve added a new “User” button and menu to our top navigation bar. This menu lets the user see the account used to log on to Azure Data Catalog, and to sign out if desired. This menu also displays the catalog name, which is valuable to developers using the Azure Data Catalog REST API.
* Standard Edition Only: When adding owners to data assets, Azure Data Catalog now supports both user accounts and security groups as owners. To add a security group as an owner for selected data assets, you can enter either the group’s display name or the group’s UPN email address, if it has one.
* Support for Azure Blob Storage data sources. Users can now register and discover Azure Storage blobs and directories.
