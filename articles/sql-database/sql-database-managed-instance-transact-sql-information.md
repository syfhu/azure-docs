# Azure SQL Database Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server 

Azure SQL Database Managed Instance (preview) provides high compatibility with on-premises SQL Server Database Engine. Most of the SQL Server Database Engine features are supported in Managed Instance. Since there are still some differences in syntax and behavior, this article summarizes and explains these differences.
 - [T-SQL differences and unsupported features](#Differences)
 - [Features that have different behavior in Managed Instance](#Changes)
 - [Temporary limitations and known issues](#Issues)

## <a name="Differences"></a> T-SQL differences from SQL Server 

This section summarizes key differences in T-SQL syntax and behavior between Managed Instance and on-premises SQL Server Database Engine, as well as unsupported features.

### Always-On availability

[High availability](sql-database-high-availability.md) is built into Managed Instance and cannot be controlled by users. The following statements are not supported:
 - [CREATE ENDPOINT â€¦ FOR DATABASE_MIRRORING](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-endpoint-transact-sql)
 - [CREATE AVAILABILITY GROUP](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-availability-group-transact-sql)
 - [ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-availability-group-transact-sql)
 - [DROP AVAILABILITY GROUP](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/drop-availability-group-transact-sql)
 - [SET HADR](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-set-hadr) clause of the [ALTER DATABASE](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql) statement

### Auditing 
 
The key differences between SQL Audit in Managed Instance, Azure SQL Database, and SQL Server on-premises are:
- In Managed Instance, SQL Audit works at the server level and stores `.xel` files on Azure blob storage account.  
- In Azure SQL Database, SQL Audit works at the database level.
- In SQL Server on-premises / virtual machine, SQL Audit works at the server level, but stores events on files system/windows event logs.  
  
XEvent auditing in Managed Instance supports Azure blob storage targets. File and windows logs are not supported.    
 
The key differences in the `CREATE AUDIT` syntax for Auditing to Azure blob storage are:
- A new syntax `TO URL` is provided and enables you to specify URL of the Azure blob Storage container where `.xel` files will be placed 
- The syntax `TO FILE` is not supported because Managed Instance cannot access Windows file shares. 
 
For more information, see:  
- [CREATE SERVER AUDIT](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-server-audit-transact-sql)  
- [ALTER SERVER AUDIT](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-server-audit-transact-sql) 
- [Auditing](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/sql-server-audit-database-engine)     

### Backup 

Managed Instance has automatic backups, and enables users to create full database `COPY_ONLY` backups. Differential, log, and file snapshot backups are not supported.  
- Managed Instance can back up a database only to an Azure Blob Storage account: 
 - Only `BACKUP TO URL` is supported 
 - `FILE`, `TAPE`, and backup devices are not supported  
- Most of the general `WITH` options are supported 
 - `COPY_ONLY` is mandatory
 - `FILE_SNAPSHOT` not supported  
 - Tape options: `REWIND`, `NOREWIND`, `UNLOAD`, and `NOUNLOAD` are not supported 
 - Log-specific options: `NORECOVERY`, `STANDBY`, and `NO_TRUNCATE` are not supported 
 
Limitations:  
- Managed Instance can back up a database to a backup with up to 32 stripes, which is enough for the databases up to 4 TB if backup compression is used.
- Max backup stripe size is 195 GB (maximum blob size). Increase the number of stripes in the backup command to reduce individual stripe size and stay within this limit. 

> [!TIP]
> To work around this limitation on-premises, backup to `DISK` instead of backup to `URL`, upload backup file to blob, then restore. Restore supports bigger files because a different blob type is used.  

For information about backups using T-SQL, see [BACKUP](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/backup-transact-sql).

### Buffer pool extension 
 
- [Buffer pool extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/buffer-pool-extension) is not supported.
- `ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION SET BUFFER POOL EXTENSION` is not supported. See [ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-server-configuration-transact-sql). 
 
### Bulk insert / openrowset

Managed Instance cannot access file shares and Windows folders, so the files must be imported from Azure blob storage.
- `DATASOURCE` is required in `BULK INSERT` command while importing files from Azure blob storage. See [BULK INSERT](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/bulk-insert-transact-sql).
- `DATASOURCE` is required in `OPENROWSET` function when you read a content of a file from Azure blob storage. See [OPENROWSET](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/functions/openrowset-transact-sql).
 
### Certificates 

Managed Instance cannot access file shares and Windows folders, so the following constraints apply: 
- `CREATE FROM`/`BACKUP TO` file is not supported for certificates
- `CREATE`/`BACKUP` certificate from `FILE`/`ASSEMBLY` is not supported. Private key files cannot be used.  
 
See [CREATE CERTIFICATE](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-certificate-transact-sql) and [BACKUP CERTIFICATE](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/backup-certificate-transact-sql).  
  
> [!TIP]
> Workaround: script certificate/private key, store as .sql file and create from binary: 
> 
> ``` 
CREATE CERTIFICATE  
 FROM BINARY = asn_encoded_certificate    
WITH PRIVATE KEY ( <private_key_options> ) 
>```   
 
### CLR 

Managed Instance cannot access file shares and Windows folders, so the following constraints apply: 
- Only `CREATE ASSEMBLY FROM BINARY` is supported. See [CREATE ASSEMBLY FROM BINARY](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-assembly-transact-sql).  
- `CREATE ASSEMBLY FROM FILE` is not supported. See [CREATE ASSEMBLY FROM FILE](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-assembly-transact-sql).
- `ALTER ASSEMBLY` cannot reference files. See [ALTER ASSEMBLY](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-assembly-transact-sql).
 
### Compatibility levels 
 
- Supported compatibility levels are: 100, 110, 120, 130, 140  
- Compatibility levels below 100 are not supported. 
- The default compatibility level for new databases is 140. For restored databases, compatibility level will remain unchanged if it was 100 and above.

See [ALTER DATABASE Compatibility Level](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-compatibility-level).
 
### Credential 
 
Only Azure Key Vault and `SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE` identities are supported. Windows users are not supported.
 
See [CREATE CREDENTIAL](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-credential-transact-sql) and [ALTER CREDENTIAL](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-credential-transact-sql). 
 
### Cryptographic providers

Managed Instance cannot access files so cryptographic providers cannot be created:
- `CREATE CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER` is not supported. See [CREATE CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-cryptographic-provider-transact-sql).
- `ALTER CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER` is not supported. See [ALTER CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-cryptographic-provider-transact-sql). 

### Collation 
 
Server collation is `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS` and cannot be changed. See [Collations](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/collations).
 
### Database options 
 
- Multiple log files are not supported. 
- In-memory objects are not supported in the General Purpose service tier.  
- There is a limit of 280 files per instance implying max 280 files per database. Both data and log files are counted toward this limit.  
- Database cannot contain filegroups containing filestream data.  Restore will fail if .bak contains `FILESTREAM` data.  
- Every file is placed in Azure Premium storage. IO and throughput per file depend on the size of each individual file, in the same way as they do for Azure Premium Storage disks. See [Azure Premium disk performance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/premium-storage-performance#premium-storage-disk-sizes)  
 
#### CREATE DATABASE statement

The following are `CREATE DATABASE` limitations: 
- Files and filegroups cannot be defined.  
- `CONTAINMENT` option is not supported.  
- `WITH`options are not supported.  
   > [!TIP]
   > As workaround, use `ALTER DATABASE` after `CREATE DATABASE` to set database options to add files or to set containment.  

- `FOR ATTACH` option is not supported 
- `AS SNAPSHOT OF` option is not supported 

For more information, see [CREATE DATABASE](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-database-sql-server-transact-sql).

#### ALTER DATABASE statement

Some file properties cannot be set or changed:
- File path cannot be specified in `ALTER DATABASE ADD FILE (FILENAME='path')` T-SQL statement. Remove `FILENAME` from the script because Managed Instance automatically places the files.  
- File name cannot be changed using `ALTER DATABASE` statement.

The following options are set by default and cannot be changed: 
- `MULTI_USER` 
- `ENABLE_BROKER ON` 
- `AUTO_CLOSE OFF` 

The following options cannot be modified: 
- `AUTO_CLOSE` 
- `AUTOMATIC_TUNING(CREATE_INDEX=ON|OFF)`

## <a name="Changes"></a> Behavior changes 
 
The following variables, functions, and views return different results:  
- `SERVERPROPERTY('EngineEdition')` returns value 8. This property uniquely identifies Managed Instance. See [SERVERPROPERTY](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/functions/serverproperty-transact-sql).
- `SERVERPROPERTY('InstanceName')` returns NULL, because the concept of instance as it exists for SQL Server does not apply to Managed Instance. See [SERVERPROPERTY('InstanceName')](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/functions/serverproperty-transact-sql).
- `@@SERVERNAME` returns full DNS 'connectable' name, for example, my-managed-instance.wcus17662feb9ce98.database.windows.net. See [@@SERVERNAME](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/functions/servername-transact-sql).  
- `SYS.SERVERS` - returns full DNS 'connectable' name, such as `myinstance.domain.database.windows.net` for properties 'name' and 'data_source'. See [SYS.SERVERS](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-servers-transact-sql). 
- `@@SERVICENAME` returns NULL, because the concept of service as it exists for SQL Server does not apply to Managed Instance. See [@@SERVICENAME](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/functions/servicename-transact-sql).   
- `SUSER_ID` is supported. Returns NULL if AAD login is not in sys.syslogins. See [SUSER_ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/functions/suser-id-transact-sql).  
- `SUSER_SID` is not supported. Returns wrong data (temporary known issue). See [SUSER_SID](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/functions/suser-sid-transact-sql). 
- `GETDATE()` and other built-in date/time functions always returns time in UTC time zone. See [GETDATE](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/functions/getdate-transact-sql).

## <a name="Issues"></a> Known issues and limitations

### TEMPDB size

`tempdb` is split into 12 files each with max size 14 GB per file. This maximum size per file cannot be changed and new files cannot be added to `tempdb`. This limitation will be removed soon. Some queries might return an error if  they need more than 168 GB in `tempdb`.

### Exceeding storage space with small database files

Each Managed Instance has up to 35 TB storage reserved for Azure Premium Disk space, and each database file is placed on a separate physical disk. Disk sizes can be 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB, 1 TB, or 4 TB. Unused space on disk is not charged, but the total sum of Azure Premium Disk sizes cannot exceed 35 TB. In some cases, a Managed Instance that does not need 8 TB in total might exceed the 35 TB Azure limit on storage size, due to internal fragmentation. 

For example, a Managed Instance could have one file 1.2 TB in size that is placed on a 4 TB disk, and 248 files each 1 GB ins size that are placed on separate 128 GB disks. In this example, 
* the total disk storage size is 1 x 4 TB + 248 x 128 GB = 35 TB. 
* the total reserved space for databases on the instance is 1 x 1.2 TB + 248 x 1 GB = 1.4 TB.
This illustrates that under certain circumstance, due to a very specific distribution of files, a Managed Instance might reach the 35TB reserved for attached Azure Premium Disk when you might not expect it to. 

In this example existing databases will continue to work and can grow without any problem as long as new files are not added. However new databases could not be created or restored because there is not enough space for new disk drives, even if the total size of all databases does not reach the instance size limit. The error that is returned in that case is not clear.

### Incorrect configuration of SAS key during database restore

`RESTORE DATABASE` that reads .bak file might be constantly retrying to read .bak file and return error after long period of time if Shared Access Signature in `CREDENTIAL` is incorrect. Execute RESTORE HEADERONLY before restoring a database to be sure that SAS key is correct.
Make sure that you remove leading `?` from the SAS key generated using Azure portal.

### Tooling

SQL Server Management Studio and SQL Server Data Tools might have some issues while accessing Managed Instance. All tooling issues will be addressed before General Availability.

### Incorrect database names

Managed Instance might show guid value instead of database name during restore or in some error messages. These issues will be corrected before General Availability.

### Database mail profile
There can be only one database mail profile and it must be called `AzureManagedInstance_dbmail_profile`. This is a temporary limitation that will be removed soon.
