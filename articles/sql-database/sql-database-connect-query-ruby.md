# Use Ruby to query an Azure SQL database

This quickstart demonstrates how to use [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) to create a program to connect to an Azure SQL database and use Transact-SQL statements to query data.

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [prerequisites-create-db](../../includes/sql-database-connect-query-prerequisites-create-db-includes.md)]

- A [server-level firewall rule](sql-database-get-started-portal.md#create-a-server-level-firewall-rule) for the public IP address of the computer you use for this quickstart.

- You have installed Ruby and related software for your operating system:
    - **MacOS**: Install Homebrew, install rbenv and ruby-build, install Ruby, and then install FreeTDS. See [Step 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/developer-get-started/ruby/mac/).
    - **Ubuntu**: Install prerequisites for Ruby, install rbenv and ruby-build, install Ruby, and then install FreeTDS. See [Step 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/developer-get-started/ruby/ubuntu/).

## SQL server connection information

[!INCLUDE [prerequisites-server-connection-info](../../includes/sql-database-connect-query-prerequisites-server-connection-info-includes.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have a firewall rule in place for the public IP address of the computer on which you perform this tutorial. If you are on a different computer or have a different public IP address, create a [server-level firewall rule using the Azure portal](sql-database-get-started-portal.md#create-a-server-level-firewall-rule). 

## Insert code to query SQL database

1. In your favorite text editor, create a new file, **sqltest.rb**

2. Replace the contents with the following code and add the appropriate values for your server, database, user, and password.

```ruby
require 'tiny_tds'
server = 'your_server.database.windows.net'
database = 'your_database'
username = 'your_username'
password = 'your_password'
client = TinyTds::Client.new username: username, password: password, 
    host: server, port: 1433, database: database, azure: true

puts "Reading data from table"
tsql = "SELECT TOP 20 pc.Name as CategoryName, p.name as ProductName
        FROM [SalesLT].[ProductCategory] pc
        JOIN [SalesLT].[Product] p
        ON pc.productcategoryid = p.productcategoryid"
result = client.execute(tsql)
result.each do |row|
    puts row
end
```

## Run the code

1. At the command prompt, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   ruby sqltest.rb
   ```

2. Verify that the top 20 rows are returned and then close the application window.
