While deployment occurs, continue to the next procedure.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For the first instance in a subnet, deployment time is typically much longer than in case of the subsequent instances - sometimes more than 24 hours to complete. Do not cancel deployment operation because it lasts longer than you expected. This length of time to deploy your first instance is a temporary situation. Expect a significant reduction of deployment time shortly after the beginning of the public preview.

## Create a new subnet in the VNet for a virtual machine

The following steps show you how to create a second subnet in the VNet for a virtual machine in which you install SQL Server Management Studio and connect to your Managed Instance.

8. Click **OK**.
9. On the summary page, review the offer details and then click **Create** to start the virtual machine deployment.
 
## Connect to virtual machine

The following steps show you how to connect to your newly created virtual machine using a remote desktop connection.

1. After deployment completes, go to the virtual machine resource.

    ![VM](./media/sql-database-managed-instance-tutorial/vm.png)  

2. Click the **Connect** button on the virtual machine properties. A Remote Desktop Protocol file (.rdp file) is created and downloaded.
3. To connect to your VM, open the downloaded RDP file. 
4. When prompted, click **Connect**. On a Mac, you need an RDP client such as this [Remote Desktop Client](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id715768417?mt=12) from the Mac App Store.

5. Enter the user name and password you specified when creating the virtual machine, then click **Ok**.

6. You may receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. Click **Yes** or **Continue** to proceed with the connection.

You are connected to your virtual machine in the Server Manager dashboard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not continue until your Managed Instance is successfully provisioned. After it is provisioned, retrieve the host name for your instance in the **Managed instance** field on the **Overview** tab for your Managed Instance. The name is similar to this: **drfadfadsfd.tr23.westus1-a.worker.database.windows.net**.

## Install SSMS and connect to the Managed Instance

The following steps show you how to download and install SSMS, and then connect to your Managed Instance.

1. In Server Manager, click **Local Server** in the left-hand pane.
