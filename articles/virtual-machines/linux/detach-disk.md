# How to detach a data disk from a Linux virtual machine

When you no longer need a data disk that's attached to a virtual machine, you can easily detach it. This removes the disk from the virtual machine, but doesn't remove it from storage. 

> [!WARNING]
> If you detach a disk it is not automatically deleted. If you have subscribed to Premium storage, you will continue to incur storage charges for the disk. For more information refer to [Pricing and Billing when using Premium Storage](../windows/premium-storage.md#pricing-and-billing). 
> 
> 

If you want to use the existing data on the disk again, you can reattach it to the same virtual machine, or another one.  

## Detach a data disk using CLI 2.0

```azurecli
az vm disk detach \
    -g myResourceGroup \
	--vm-name myVm \
	-n myDataDisk
```

The disk remains in storage but is no longer attached to a virtual machine.


## Detach a data disk using the portal
1. In the left menu, select **Virtual Machines**.
2. Select the virtual machine that has the data disk you want to detach and click **Stop** to deallocate the VM.
3. In the virtual machine pane, select **Disks**.
4. At the top of the **Disks** pane, select **Edit**.
5. In the **Disks** pane, to the far right of the data disk that you would like to detach, click the ![Detach button image](./media/detach-disk/detach.png) detach button.
5. After the disk has been removed, click Save on the top of the pane.
6. In the virtual machine pane, click **Overview** and then click the **Start** button at the top of the pane to restart the VM.

The disk remains in storage but is no longer attached to a virtual machine.


## Next steps
If you want to reuse the data disk, you can just [attach it to another VM](add-disk.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).
