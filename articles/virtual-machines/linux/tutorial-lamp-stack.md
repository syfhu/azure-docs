# Tutorial: Install a LAMP web server on a Linux virtual machine in Azure

This article walks you through how to deploy an Apache web server, MySQL, and PHP (the LAMP stack) on an Ubuntu VM in Azure. If you prefer the NGINX web server, see the [LEMP stack](tutorial-lemp-stack.md) tutorial. To see the LAMP server in action, you can optionally install and configure a WordPress site. In this tutorial you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an Ubuntu VM (the 'L' in the LAMP stack)
> * Open port 80 for web traffic
> * Install Apache, MySQL, and PHP
> * Verify installation and configuration
> * Install WordPress on the LAMP server

This setup is for quick tests or proof of concept. For more on the LAMP stack, including recommendations for a production environment, see the [Ubuntu documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP).

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.30 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Install Apache, MySQL, and PHP

Run the following command to update Ubuntu package sources and install Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Note the caret (^) at the end of the command, which is part of the `lamp-server^` package name. 


```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install lamp-server^
```


You are prompted to install the packages and other dependencies. When prompted, set a root password for MySQL, and then [Enter] to continue. Follow the remaining prompts. This process installs the minimum required PHP extensions needed to use PHP with MySQL.

## Verify installation and configuration


### Apache

Check the version of Apache with the following command:
```bash
apache2 -v
```

With Apache installed, and port 80 open to your VM, the web server can now be accessed from the internet. To view the Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page, open a web browser, and enter the public IP address of the VM. Use the public IP address you used to SSH to the VM:

### MySQL

Check the version of MySQL with the following command (note the capital `V` parameter):

```bash
mysql -V
```

To help secure the installation of MySQL, run the `mysql_secure_installation` script. If you are only setting up a temporary server, you can skip this step.

```bash
mysql_secure_installation
```

Enter a root password for MySQL, and configure the security settings for your environment.

If you want to try MySQL features (create a MySQL database, add users, or change configuration settings), login to MySQL. This step is not required to complete this tutorial.

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

When done, exit the mysql prompt by typing `\q`.

### PHP

Check the version of PHP with the following command:

```bash
php -v
```

If you want to test further, create a quick PHP info page to view in a browser. The following command creates the PHP info page:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > /var/www/html/info.php'
```

Now you can check the PHP info page you created. Open a browser and go to `http://yourPublicIPAddress/info.php`. Substitute the public IP address of your VM. It should look similar to this image.
