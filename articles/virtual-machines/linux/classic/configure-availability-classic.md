# How to configure an availability set for Linux virtual machines in the classic deployment model
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources: [Resource Manager and Classic](../../../resource-manager-deployment-model.md). This article covers using the Classic deployment model. Microsoft recommends that most new deployments use the Resource Manager model. You can also [configure availability sets](../../azure-cli-arm-commands.md#azure-availset-commands-to-manage-your-availability-sets) in Resource Manager deployments.
