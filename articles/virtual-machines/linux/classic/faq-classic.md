# Frequently asked question about Azure Linux Virtual Machines created with the classic deployment model
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources: [Resource Manager and Classic](../../../resource-manager-deployment-model.md). This article covers using the Classic deployment model. Microsoft recommends that most new deployments use the Resource Manager model. For the FAQ when using the Resource Manager model, see [here](../faq.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).
