# SAP HANA (large instances) infrastructure and connectivity on Azure 

Some definitions upfront before reading this guide. In [SAP HANA (large instances) overview and architecture on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-overview-architecture) we introduced two different classes of HANA Large Instance units with:

- S72, S72m, S144, S144m, S192, S192m, and S192xm, which we refer to as the 'Type I class' of SKUs.
- S384, S384m, S384xm, S384xxm, S576m, S576xm, S768m, S768xm and S960m, which we refer to as the 'Type II class' of SKUs.

The class specifiers are going to be used throughout the HANA Large Instance documentation to eventually refer to different capabilities and requirements based on HANA Large Instance SKUs.

Other definitions we use frequently are:
- **Large Instance stamp:** A hardware infrastructure stack that is SAP HANA TDI certified and dedicated to run SAP HANA instances within Azure.
- **SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances):** Official name for the offer in Azure to run HANA instances in on SAP HANA TDI certified hardware that is deployed in Large Instance stamps in different Azure regions. The related term **HANA Large Instance** is short for SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) and is widely used this technical deployment guide.
 

After the purchase of SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) is finalized between you and the Microsoft enterprise account team, the following information is required by Microsoft to deploy HANA Large Instance Units:

- Customer name
- Business contact information (including e-mail address and phone number)
- Technical contact information (including e-mail address and phone number)
- Technical networking contact information (including e-mail address and phone number)
- Azure deployment region (West US, East US, Australia East, Australia Southeast, West Europe, and North Europe as of July 2017)
- Confirm SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) SKU (configuration)
- As already detailed in the Overview and Architecture document for HANA Large Instances, for every Azure Region being deployed to:
	- A /29 IP address range for ER-P2P Connections that connect Azure VNets to HANA Large Instances
	- A /24 CIDR Block used for the HANA Large Instances Server IP Pool
- The IP address range values used in the VNet Address Space attribute of every Azure VNet that connects to the HANA Large Instances
- Data for each of HANA Large Instances system:
  - Desired hostname - ideally with fully qualified domain name.
  - Desired IP address for the HANA Large Instance unit out of the Server IP Pool address range - Keep in mind that the first 30 IP addresses in the Server IP Pool address range are reserved for internal usage within HANA Large Instances
  - SAP HANA SID name for the SAP HANA instance (required to create the necessary SAP HANA-related disk volumes). The HANA SID is required for creating the permissions for sidadm on the NFS volumes, which are getting attached to the HANA Large Instance unit. It also is used as one of the name components of the disk volumes that get mounted. If you want to run more than one HANA instance on the unit, you need to list multiple HANA SIDs. Each one gets a separate set of volumes assigned.
  - The groupid the sidadm user has in the Linux OS is required to create the necessary SAP HANA-related disk volumes. The SAP HANA installation usually creates the sapsys group with a group id of 1001. The sidadm user is part of that group
  - The userid the sidadm user has in the Linux OS is required to create the necessary SAP HANA-related disk volumes. If you are running multiple HANA instances on the unit, you need to list all the <sid>adm users 
- Azure subscription ID for the Azure subscription to which SAP HANA on Azure HANA Large Instances are going to be directly connected. This subscription ID references the Azure subscription, which is going to be charged with the HANA Large Instance unit(s).

After you provide the information, Microsoft provisions SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) and will return the information necessary to link your Azure VNets to HANA Large Instances and to access the HANA Large Instance units.

## Connecting Azure VMs to HANA Large Instances

As already mentioned in [SAP HANA (large instances) overview and architecture on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-overview-architecture) the minimal deployment of HANA Large Instances with the SAP application layer in Azure looks like:

![Azure VNet connected to SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) and on-premises](./media/hana-overview-architecture/image3-on-premises-infrastructure.png)

Looking closer on the Azure VNet side, we realize the need for:

- The definition of an Azure VNet that is going to be used to deploy the VMs of the SAP application layer into.
- That automatically means that a default subnet in the Azure Vnet is defined that is really the one used to deploy the VMs into.
- The Azure VNet that's created needs to have at least one VM subnet and one ExpressRoute Gateway subnet. These subnets should be assigned the IP address ranges as specified and discussed in the following sections.

So, let's look a bit closer into the Azure VNet creation for HANA Large Instances

### Creating the Azure VNet for HANA Large Instances

>[!Note]
>The Azure VNet for HANA Large Instance must be created using the Azure Resource Manager deployment model. The older Azure deployment model, commonly known as classic deployment model, is not supported with the HANA Large Instance solution.

The VNet can be created using the Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure template, or Azure CLI (see [Create a virtual network using the Azure portal](../../../virtual-network/manage-virtual-network.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json#create-a-virtual-network)). In the following example, we look into a VNet created through the Azure portal.

If we look into the definitions of an Azure VNet through the Azure portal, let's look into some of the definitions and how those relate to what we list of different IP address ranges. As we are talking about the **Address Space**, we mean the address space that the Azure VNet is allowed to use. This address space is also the address range that the VNet uses for BGP route propagation. This **Address Space** can be seen here:

![Address Space of Azure VNet displayed in the Azure portal](./media/hana-overview-connectivity/image1-azure-vnet-address-space.png)

In the case preceding, with 10.16.0.0/16, the Azure VNet was given a rather large and wide IP address range to use. Means all the IP address ranges of subsequent subnets within this VNet can have their ranges within that 'Address Space'. Usually we are not recommending such a large address range for single VNet in Azure. But getting a step further, let's look into the subnets defined in the Azure VNet:

![Azure VNet Subnets and their IP address ranges](./media/hana-overview-connectivity/image2b-vnet-subnets.png)

As you can see, we look at a VNet with a first VM subnet (here called 'default') and a subnet called 'GatewaySubnet'.
In the following section, we refer to the IP address range of the subnet, which was called 'default' in the graphics as **Azure VM subnet IP address range**. In the following sections, we refer to the IP address range of the Gateway Subnet as **VNet Gateway Subnet IP address range**. 

In the case demonstrated by the two graphics above, you see that the **VNet Address Space** covers both, the **Azure VM subnet IP address range** and the **VNet Gateway Subnet IP address range**. 

In other cases where you need to conserve or be specific with your IP address ranges, you can restrict the **VNet Address Space** of a VNet to the specific ranges being used by each subnet. In this case, you can define the **VNet Address Space** of a VNet as multiple specific ranges as shown here:

![Azure VNet Address Space with two spaces](./media/hana-overview-connectivity/image3-azure-vnet-address-space_alternate.png)

In this case, the **VNet Address Space** has two spaces defined. These two spaces, are identical to the IP address ranges defined for **Azure VM subnet IP address range** and the **VNet Gateway Subnet IP address range.**

You can use any naming standard you like for these tenant subnets (VM subnets). However, **there must always be one, and only one, gateway subnet for each VNet** that connects to the SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) ExpressRoute circuit. And **this gateway subnet must always be named "GatewaySubnet"** to ensure proper placement of the ExpressRoute gateway.

> [!WARNING] 
> It is critical that the gateway subnet always is named "GatewaySubnet."

Multiple VM subnets may be used, even utilizing non-contiguous address ranges. But as mentioned previously, these address ranges must be covered by the **VNet Address Space** of the VNet either in aggregated form or in a list of the exact ranges of the VM subnets and the gateway subnet.

Summarizing the important fact about an Azure VNet that connects to HANA Large Instances:

- You need to submit to Microsoft the **VNet Address Space** when performing an initial deployment of HANA Large Instances. 
- The **VNet Address Space** can be one larger range that covers the range for Azure VM subnet IP address range(s) and the VNet Gateway Subnet IP address range.
- Or you can submit as **VNet Address Space** multiple ranges that cover the different IP address ranges of VM subnet IP address range(s) and the VNet Gateway Subnet IP address range.
- The defined **VNet Address Space** is used BGP routing propagation.
- The name of the Gateway subnet must be: **"GatewaySubnet."**
- The **VNet Address Space** is used as a filter on the HANA Large Instance side to allow or disallow traffic to the HANA Large Instance units from Azure. If the BGP routing information of the Azure VNet and the IP address ranges configured for filtering on the HANA Large Instance side do not match, issues in connectivity can arise.
- There are some details about the Gateway subnet that are discussed further down in Section 'Connecting a VNet to HANA Large Instance ExpressRoute'



### Different IP address ranges to be defined 

We already introduced some of the IP address ranges necessary to deploy HANA Large Instances in earlier sections. But there are some more IP address ranges, which are important. Let's go through some further details. The following IP addresses of which not all need to be submitted to Microsoft need to be defined, before sending a request for initial deployment:

- **VNet Address Space:** As already introduced earlier, is or are the IP address range(s) you have assigned (or plan to assign) to your address space parameter in the Azure Virtual Network(s) (VNet) connecting to the SAP HANA Large Instance environment. It is recommended that this Address Space parameter is a multi-line value comprised of the Azure VM Subnet range(s) and the Azure Gateway subnet range as shown in the graphics earlier. This range must NOT overlap with your on-premises or Server IP Pool or ER-P2P address ranges. How to get this or these IP address range(s)? Your corporate network team or service provider should provide one or multiple IP Address Range(s), which is or are not used inside your network. Example: If your Azure VM Subnet (see earlier) is 10.0.1.0/24, and your Azure Gateway Subnet (see following) is 10.0.2.0/28, then your Azure VNet Address Space is recommended to be two lines; 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/28. Although the Address Space values can be aggregated, it is recommended matching them to the subnet ranges to avoid accidental reuse of unused IP address ranges within larger address spaces in the future elsewhere in your network. **The VNET Address Space is an IP address range, which needs to be submitted to Microsoft when asking for an initial deployment**

- **Azure VM subnet IP address range:** This IP address range, as discussed earlier already, is the one you have assigned (or plan to assign) to the Azure VNet subnet parameter in your Azure VNET connecting to the SAP HANA Large Instance environment. This IP address range is used to assign IP addresses to your Azure VMs. The IP addresses out of this range are allowed to connect to your SAP HANA Large Instance server(s). If needed, multiple Azure VM subnets may be used. A /24 CIDR block is recommended by Microsoft for each Azure VM Subnet. This address range must be a part of the values used in the Azure VNet Address Space. How to get this IP address range? Your corporate network team or service provider should provide an IP Address Range, which is not currently used inside your network.

- **VNet Gateway Subnet IP address range:** Depending on the features you plan to use, the recommended size would be:
   - Ultra-performance ExpressRoute gateway: /26 address block - required for Type II class of SKUs
   - Co-existence with VPN and ExpressRoute using a High-performance ExpressRoute Gateway (or smaller): /27 address block
   - All other situations: /28 address block. This address range must be a part of the values used in the "VNet Address Space" values. This address range must be a part of the values used in the Azure VNet Address Space values that you need to submit to Microsoft. How to get this IP address range? Your corporate network team or service provider should provide an IP Address Range, which is not currently used inside your network. 

- **Address range for ER-P2P connectivity:** This range is the IP range for your SAP HANA Large Instance ExpressRoute (ER) P2P connection. This range of IP addresses must be a /29 CIDR IP address range. This range must NOT overlap with your on-premises or other Azure IP address ranges. This IP address range is used to set up the ER connectivity from your Azure VNet ExpressRoute Gateway to the SAP HANA Large Instance servers. How to get this IP address range? Your corporate network team or service provider should provide an IP Address Range, which is not currently used inside your network. **This range is an IP address range, which needs to be submitted to Microsoft when asking for an initial deployment**
  
- **Server IP Pool Address Range:** This IP address range is used to assign the individual IP address to HANA large instance servers. The recommended subnet size is a /24 CIDR block - but if needed it can be smaller to a minimum of providing 64 IP addresses. From this range, the first 30 IP addresses are reserved for use by Microsoft. Ensure this fact is accounted for when choosing the size of the range. This range must NOT overlap with your on-premises or other Azure IP addresses. How to get this IP address range? Your corporate network team or service provider should provide an IP Address Range which is not currently used inside your network. A /24 (recommended) unique CIDR block to be used for assigning the specific IP addresses needed for SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances). **This range is an IP address range, which needs to be submitted to Microsoft when asking for an initial deployment**
 
Though you need to define and plan the IP address ranges above, not all them need to be transmitted to Microsoft. To summarize the above, the IP address ranges you are required to name to Microsoft are:

- Azure VNet Address Space(s)
- Address range for ER-P2P connectivity
- Server IP Pool Address Range

Adding additional VNets that need to connect to HANA Large Instances, requires you to submit the new Azure VNet Address Space you're adding to Microsoft. 

Following is an example of the different ranges and some example ranges as you need to configure and eventually provide to Microsoft. As you can see, the value for the Azure VNet Address Space is not aggregated in the first example, but is defined from the ranges of the first Azure VM subnet IP address range and the VNet Gateway Subnet IP address range. Using multiple VM subnets within the Azure VNet would work accordingly by configuring and submitting the additional IP address ranges of the additional VM subnet(s) as part of the Azure VNet Address Space.

![IP address ranges required in SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) minimal deployment](./media/hana-overview-connectivity/image4b-ip-addres-ranges-necessary.png)

You also have the possibility of aggregating the data you submit to Microsoft. In that case, the Address Space of the Azure VNet only would include one space. Using the IP address ranges used in the example earlier. This aggregated VNet Address space could look like:

![Second possibility of IP address ranges required in SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) minimal deployment](./media/hana-overview-connectivity/image5b-ip-addres-ranges-necessary-one-value.png)

As you can see above, instead of two smaller ranges that defined the address space of the Azure VNet, we have one larger range that covers 4096 IP addresses. Such a large definition of the Address Space leaves some rather large ranges unused. Since the VNet Address Space value(s) are used for BGP route propagation, usage of the unused ranges on-premises or elsewhere in your network can cause routing issues. So it's recommended to keep the Address Space tightly aligned with the actual subnet address space used. If needed, without incurring downtime on the VNet, you can always add new Address Space values later.
 
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Each IP address range of ER-P2P, Server IP Pool, Azure VNet Address Space must **NOT** overlap with each other or any other range used somewhere else in your network; each must be discrete and as the two graphics earlier show, may not be a subnet of any other range. If overlaps occur between ranges, the Azure VNet may not connect to the ExpressRoute circuit.

### Next steps after address ranges have been defined
After the IP address ranges have been defined, the following activities need to happen:

1. Submit the IP address ranges for Azure VNet Address Space, the ER-P2P connectivity, and Server IP Pool Address Range, together with other data that has been listed at the beginning of the document. At this point in time, you also could start to create the VNet and the VM Subnets. 
2. An Express Route circuit is created by Microsoft between your Azure subscription and the HANA Large Instance stamp.
3. A tenant network is created on the Large Instance stamp by Microsoft.
4. Microsoft configures networking in the SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) infrastructure to accept IP addresses from your Azure VNet Address Space that communicates with HANA Large Instances.
5. Depending on the specific SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) SKU purchased, Microsoft assigns a compute unit in a tenant network, allocate and mount storage, and install the operating system (SUSE or Red Hat Linux). IP addresses for these units are taken out of the Server IP Pool address Range you submitted to Microsoft.

At the end of the deployment process, Microsoft delivers the following data to you:
- Information needed to connect your Azure VNet(s) to the ExpressRoute circuit that connects Azure VNets to HANA Large Instances:
     - Authorization key(s)
     - ExpressRoute PeerID
- Data to access HANA Large Instances after you established ExpressRoute circuit and Azure VNet.

You can also find the sequence of connecting HANA Large Instances in the document [End to End Setup for SAP HANA Large Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/sap-hana-on-azure-large-instances-setup/). Many of the following steps are shown in an example deployment in that document. 


## Connecting a VNet to HANA Large Instance ExpressRoute

As you defined all the IP address ranges and now got the data back from Microsoft, you can start connecting the VNet you created before to HANA Large Instances. Once the Azure VNet is created, an ExpressRoute gateway must be created on the VNet to link the VNet to the ExpressRoute circuit that connects to the customer tenant on the Large Instance stamp.

> [!NOTE] 
> This step can take up to 30 minutes to complete, as the new gateway is created in the designated Azure subscription and then connected to the specified Azure VNet.

If a gateway already exists, check whether it is an ExpressRoute gateway or not. If not, the gateway must be deleted and recreated as an ExpressRoute gateway. If an ExpressRoute gateway is already established, since the Azure VNet is already connected to the ExpressRoute circuit for on-premises connectivity, proceed to the Linking VNets section below.

- Use either the (new) [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), or PowerShell to create an ExpressRoute VPN gateway connected to your VNet.
  - If you use the Azure portal, add a new **Virtual Network Gateway** and then select **ExpressRoute** as the gateway type.
  - If you chose PowerShell instead, first download and use the latest [Azure PowerShell SDK](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/) to ensure an optimal experience. The following commands create an ExpressRoute gateway. The texts preceded by a _$_ are user defined variables that need to be updated with your specific information.

```PowerShell
# These Values should already exist, update to match your environment
$myAzureRegion = "eastus"
$myGroupName = "SAP-East-Coast"
$myVNetName = "VNet01"

# These values are used to create the gateway, update for how you wish the GW components to be named
$myGWName = "VNet01GW"
$myGWConfig = "VNet01GWConfig"
$myGWPIPName = "VNet01GWPIP"
$myGWSku = "HighPerformance" # Supported values for HANA Large Instances are: HighPerformance or UltraPerformance

# These Commands create the Public IP and ExpressRoute Gateway
$vnet = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -Name $myVNetName -ResourceGroupName $myGroupName
$subnet = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name 'GatewaySubnet' -VirtualNetwork $vnet
New-AzureRmPublicIpAddress -Name $myGWPIPName -ResourceGroupName $myGroupName `
-Location $myAzureRegion -AllocationMethod Dynamic
$gwpip = Get-AzureRmPublicIpAddress -Name $myGWPIPName -ResourceGroupName $myGroupName
$gwipconfig = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGatewayIpConfig -Name $myGWConfig -SubnetId $subnet.Id `
-PublicIpAddressId $gwpip.Id

New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $myGWName -ResourceGroupName $myGroupName -Location $myAzureRegion `
-IpConfigurations $gwipconfig -GatewayType ExpressRoute `
-GatewaySku $myGWSku -VpnType PolicyBased -EnableBgp $true
```

In this example, the HighPerformance gateway SKU was used. Your options are HighPerformance or UltraPerformance as the only gateway SKUs that are supported for SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For HANA Large Instances of the Type II classs SKU, the usage of the UltraPerformance Gateway SKU is mandatory.

### Linking VNets

Now that the Azure VNet has an ExpressRoute gateway, you use the authorization information provided by Microsoft to connect the ExpressRoute gateway to the SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) ExpressRoute circuit created for this connectivity. This step can be performed using the Azure portal or PowerShell. The portal is recommended, however PowerShell instructions are as follows. 

- You execute the following commands for each VNet gateway using a different AuthGUID for each connection. The first two entries shown in the script following come from the information provided by Microsoft. Also, the AuthGUID is specific for every VNet and its gateway. Means, if you want to add another Azure VNet, you need to get another AuthID for your ExpressRoute circuit that connects HANA Large Instances into Azure. 

```PowerShell
# Populate with information provided by Microsoft Onboarding team
$PeerID = "/subscriptions/9cb43037-9195-4420-a798-f87681a0e380/resourceGroups/Customer-USE-Circuits/providers/Microsoft.Network/expressRouteCircuits/Customer-USE01"
$AuthGUID = "76d40466-c458-4d14-adcf-3d1b56d1cd61"

# Your ExpressRoute Gateway Information
$myGroupName = "SAP-East-Coast"
$myGWName = "VNet01GW"
$myGWLocation = "East US"

# Define the name for your connection
$myConnectionName = "VNet01GWConnection"

# Create a new connection between the ER Circuit and your Gateway using the Authorization
$gw = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $myGWName -ResourceGroupName $myGroupName
    
New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name $myConnectionName `
-ResourceGroupName $myGroupName -Location $myGWLocation -VirtualNetworkGateway1 $gw `
-PeerId $PeerID -ConnectionType ExpressRoute -AuthorizationKey $AuthGUID
```

If you want to connect the gateway to multiple ExpressRoute circuits that are associated with your subscription, you may need to execute this step more than once. For example, you are likely going to connect the same VNet Gateway to the ExpressRoute circuit that connects the VNet to your on-premises network.

## Adding more IP addresses or subnets

Use either the Azure portal, PowerShell, or CLI when adding more IP addresses or subnets.

In this case, the recommendation is to add the new IP address range as new range to the VNet Address Space instead of generating a new aggregated range. In either case, you need to submit this change to Microsoft to allow connectivity out of that new IP address range to the HANA Large Instance units in your client. You can open an Azure support request to get the new VNet Address space added. After you receive confirmation, perform the next steps.

To create an additional subnet from the Azure portal, see the article [Create a virtual network using the Azure portal](../../../virtual-network/manage-virtual-network.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json#create-a-virtual-network), and to create from PowerShell, see [Create a virtual network using PowerShell](../../../virtual-network/manage-virtual-network.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json#create-a-virtual-network).

## Adding VNets

After initially connecting one or more Azure VNets, you might want to add additional ones that access SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances). First, submit an Azure support request, in that request include both the specific information identifying the particular Azure deployment, and the IP address space range(s) of the Azure VNet Address Space. SAP HANA on Azure Service Management then provides the necessary information you need to connect the additional VNets and ExpressRoute. For every VNet, you need a unique Authorization Key to connect to the ExpressRoute Circuit to HANA Large Instances.

Steps to add a new Azure VNet:

1. Complete the first step in the onboarding process, see the _Creating Azure VNet_ section.
2. Complete the second step in the onboarding process, see the _Creating gateway subnet_ section.
3. To connect your additional VNets to the HANA Large Instance ExpressRoute circuit, open an Azure support request with information on the new VNet and request a new Authorization Key.
4. Once notified that the authorization is complete, use the Microsoft-provided authorization information to complete the third step in the onboarding process, see the _Linking VNets_ section.

## Increasing ExpressRoute circuit bandwidth

Consult with SAP HANA on Azure Service Management. If you are advised to increase the bandwidth of the SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) ExpressRoute circuit, create an Azure support request. (You can request an increase for a single circuit bandwidth up to a maximum of 10 Gbps.) You then receive notification after the operation is complete; no additional action needed to enable this higher speed in Azure.

## Adding an additional ExpressRoute circuit

Consult with SAP HANA on Azure Service Management, if you are advised that an additional ExpressRoute circuit is needed, make an Azure support request to create a new ExpressRoute circuit (and to get authorization information to connect to it). The address space that is going be used on the VNets must be defined before making the request, in order for SAP HANA on Azure Service Management to provide authorization.

Once the new circuit is created and the SAP HANA on Azure Service Management configuration is complete, you are going to receive notification with the information you need to proceed. Follow the steps provided above for creating and connecting the new VNet to this additional circuit. You are not able to connect Azure VNets to this additional circuit if they already connected to another SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instance) ExpressRoute circuit in the same Azure Region.

## Deleting a subnet

To remove a VNet subnet, either the Azure portal, PowerShell, or CLI can be used. In case your Azure VNet IP address range/Azure VNet Address Space was an aggregated range, there is no follow up for you with Microsoft. Except that the VNet is still propagating BGP route address space that includes the deleted subnet. If you defined the Azure VNet IP address range/Azure VNet Address Space as multiple IP address ranges of which one was assigned to your deleted subnet, you should delete that out of your VNet Address Space and subsequently inform  SAP HANA on Azure Service Management to remove it from the ranges that SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) is allowed to communicate with.

To delete a subnet, see [Delete a subnet](../../../virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-subnet.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json#delete-a-subnet) for more information on creating subnets.

## Deleting a VNet

To delete a virtual network, see [Delete a virtual network](../../../virtual-network/manage-virtual-network.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json#delete-a-virtual-network). SAP HANA on Azure Service Management removes the existing authorizations on the SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) ExpressRoute circuit and remove the Azure VNet IP address range/Azure VNet Address Space for the communication with HANA Large Instances.

Once the VNet has been removed, open an Azure support request to provide the IP address space range(s) to be removed.

To ensure everything is removed, delete the following items:

- The ExpressRoute connection, VNet Gateway, VNet Gateway Public IP and, VNet

## Deleting an ExpressRoute circuit

To remove an additional SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) ExpressRoute circuit, open an Azure support request with SAP HANA on Azure Service Management and request that the circuit should be deleted. Within the Azure subscription, you may delete or keep the VNet as necessary. However, you must delete the connection between the HANA Large Instances ExpressRoute circuit and the linked VNet gateway.

If you also want to remove a VNet, follow the guidance on Deleting a VNet in the section above.
