# Create an Operations Management Suite monitored VM with PowerShell

This script creates an Azure Virtual Machine, installs the Operations Management Suite (OMS) agent, and enrolls the system with an OMS workspace. Once the script has run, the virtual machine will be visible in the OMS console. Also, you need to update the OMS workspace ID and workspace key.

[!INCLUDE [sample-powershell-install](../../../includes/sample-powershell-install-no-ssh.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/virtual-machine/create-vm-monitor-oms/create-windows-vm-detailed-oms.ps1 "Create VM OMS")]

## Clean up deployment

Run the following command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create the deployment. Each item in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [New-AzureRmResourceGroup](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/new-azurermresourcegroup) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [New-AzureRmVM](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/new-azurermvm) | Creates the virtual machine and connects it to the network card, virtual network, subnet, and network security group. This command also opens port 80 and sets the administrative credentials. |
| [Set-AzureRmVMExtension](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/set-azurermvmextension) | Add a VM extension to the virtual machine. In this case, the Operations Management Suite agent extension is used to install the OMS agent and enroll the VM in an OMS workspace. |
|[Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/remove-azurermresourcegroup) | Removes a resource group and all resources contained within. |
