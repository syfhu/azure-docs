# Create a VM with a virtual hard disk

This example creates a virtual machine using a VHD.
It creates a resource group, a storage account, and a container,
then it creates a VM by uploading the VHD to the container.
It replaces the ssh public key with your public key so that you have access to the VM.

You'll need a bootable VHD.
You can download the VHD that we used from https://azclisamples.blob.core.windows.net/vhds/sample.vhd,
or use your own VHD. The script looks for `~/sample.vhd`.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-vm-vhd/create-vm-vhd.sh "Create VM using a VHD")]

## Clean up deployment 

Run the following command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive 
az group delete -n az-cli-vhd
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, virtual machine, availability set, load balancer, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group#az_group_create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az storage account list](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/account#az_storage_account_list) | Lists storage accounts |
| [az storage account check-name](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/account#az_storage_account_check_name) | Checks that a storage account name is valid and that it doesn't already exist |
| [az storage account keys list](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/account/keys#az_storage_account_keys_list) | Lists keys for the storage accounts |
| [az storage blob exists](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/blob#az_storage_blob_exists) | Checks whether the blob exists |
| [az storage container create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/container#az_storage_container_create) | Creates a container in a storage account. |
| [az storage blob upload](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/blob#az_storage_blob_upload) | Creates a blob in the container by uploading the VHD. |
| [az vm list](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm#az_vm_list) | Used with `--query` check whether the VM name is in use. | 
| [az vm create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/availability-set#az_vm_availability_set_create) | Creates the virtual machines. |
| [az vm access set-linux-user](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/access#az_vm_access_set_linux_user) | Resets the SSH key to give the current user access to the VM. |
| [az vm list-ip-addresses](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm#az_vm_list-ip-addresses) | Gets the IP address of the VM that was created. |
