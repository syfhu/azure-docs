# How to detach a disk from a Windows virtual machine
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure has two distinct deployment models for creating and working with resources: [Resource Manager and Classic](../../../resource-manager-deployment-model.md). This article covers using the Classic deployment model. Microsoft recommends that most new deployments use the Resource Manager model. For information about how to detach a disk using the Resource Manager model, see [here](../../virtual-machines-windows-detach-disk.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json).
