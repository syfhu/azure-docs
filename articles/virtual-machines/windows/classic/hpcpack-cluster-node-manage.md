# Manage the number and availability of compute nodes in an HPC Pack cluster in Azure
If you created an HPC Pack 2012 R2 cluster in Azure VMs, you might want ways to easily add, remove,
start (provision), or stop (deprovision) some compute node VMs in the
cluster. To do these tasks, run Azure PowerShell scripts that are
installed on the head node VM. These scripts help you control the number
and availability of your HPC Pack cluster resources so you can control costs.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This article applies only to HPC Pack 2012 R2 clusters in Azure created using the classic deployment model. Microsoft recommends that most new deployments use the Resource Manager model.
> In addition, the PowerShell scripts described in this article are not available in HPC Pack 2016.

## Prerequisites
* **HPC Pack 2012 R2 cluster in Azure VMs**: Create an HPC Pack 2012 R2 cluster in the classic deployment model. For example, you can automate the deployment by using the HPC Pack 2012 R2 VM image in the Azure Marketplace and an Azure PowerShell script. For information and prerequisites, see [Create an HPC Cluster with the HPC Pack IaaS deployment script](hpcpack-cluster-powershell-script.md).
  
    After deployment, find the node management scripts in the %CCP\_HOME%bin folder on the head node. Run each of the scripts as an administrator.
* **Azure publish settings file or management certificate**: You need to do one of the following on the head node:
  
  * **Import the Azure publish settings file**. To do this, run the following Azure PowerShell cmdlets on the head node:
    
    ```PowerShell
    Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile
    
    Import-AzurePublishSettingsFile –PublishSettingsFile <publish settings file>
    ```
  * **Configure the Azure management certificate on the head node**. If you have the .cer file, import it in the CurrentUser\My certificate store and then run the following Azure PowerShell cmdlet for your Azure environment (either AzureCloud or AzureChinaCloud):
    
    ```PowerShell
    Set-AzureSubscription -SubscriptionName <Sub Name> -SubscriptionId <Sub ID> -Certificate (Get-Item Cert:\CurrentUser\My\<Cert Thrumbprint>) -Environment <AzureCloud | AzureChinaCloud>
    ```

## Add compute node VMs
Add compute nodes with the **Add-HpcIaaSNode.ps1** script.

### Syntax
```PowerShell
Add-HPCIaaSNode.ps1 [-ServiceName] <String> [-ImageName] <String>
 [-Quantity] <Int32> [-InstanceSize] <String> [-DomainUserName] <String> [[-DomainUserPassword] <String>]
 [[-NodeNameSeries] <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

```
### Parameters
* **ServiceName**: Name of the cloud service that new compute node VMs are added to.
* **ImageName**: Azure VM image name, which can be obtained through the Azure portal or Azure PowerShell cmdlet **Get-AzureVMImage**. The image must meet the following requirements:
  
  1. A Windows operating system must be installed.
  2. HPC Pack must be installed in the compute node role.
  3. The image must be a private image in the User category, not a public Azure VM image.
* **Quantity**: Number of compute node VMs to be added.
* **InstanceSize**: Size of the compute node VMs.
* **DomainUserName**: Domain user name, which is used to join the new VMs to the domain.
* **DomainUserPassword**: Password of the domain user.
* **NodeNameSeries** (optional): Naming pattern for the compute nodes. The format must be &lt;*Root\_Name*&gt;&lt;*Start\_Number*&gt;%. For example, MyCN%10% means a series of the compute node names starting from MyCN11. If not specified, the script uses the configured node naming series in the HPC cluster.

### Example
The following example adds 20 size Large compute node VMs in the cloud
service *hpcservice1*, based on the VM image *hpccnimage1*.

```PowerShell
Add-HPCIaaSNode.ps1 –ServiceName hpcservice1 –ImageName hpccniamge1
–Quantity 20 –InstanceSize Large –DomainUserName <username>
-DomainUserPassword <password>
```


## Remove compute node VMs
Remove compute nodes with the **Remove-HpcIaaSNode.ps1** script.

### Syntax
```PowerShell
Remove-HPCIaaSNode.ps1 -Name <String[]> [-DeleteVHD] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]

Remove-HPCIaaSNode.ps1 -Node <Object> [-DeleteVHD] [-Force] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Parameters
* **Name**: Names of cluster nodes to be removed. Wildcards are supported. The parameter set name is Name. You can't specify both the **Name** and **Node** parameters.
* **Node**: The HpcNode object for the nodes to be removed, which can be obtained through the HPC PowerShell cmdlet [Get-HpcNode](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn887927.aspx). The parameter set name is Node. You can't specify both the **Name** and **Node** parameters.
* **DeleteVHD** (optional): Setting to delete the associated disks for the VMs that are removed.
* **Force** (optional): Setting to force HPC nodes offline before removing them.
* **Confirm** (optional): Prompt for confirmation before executing the command.
* **WhatIf**: Setting to describe what would happen if you executed the command without actually executing the command.

### Example
The following example forces offline the nodes with names beginning
*HPCNode-CN-* and them removes the nodes and their associated disks.

```PowerShell
Remove-HPCIaaSNode.ps1 –Name HPCNodeCN-* –DeleteVHD -Force
```

## Start compute node VMs
Start compute nodes with the **Start-HpcIaaSNode.ps1** script.

### Syntax
```PowerShell
Start-HPCIaaSNode.ps1 -Name <String[]> [<CommonParameters>]

Start-HPCIaaSNode.ps1 -Node <Object> [<CommonParameters>]
```
### Parameters
* **Name**: Names of the cluster nodes to be started. Wildcards are supported. The parameter set name is Name. You cannot specify both the **Name** and **Node** parameters.
* **Node**- The HpcNode object for the nodes to be started, which can be obtained through the HPC PowerShell cmdlet [Get-HpcNode](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn887927.aspx). The parameter set name is Node. You cannot specify both the **Name** and **Node** parameters.

### Example
The following example starts nodes with names beginning *HPCNode-CN-*.

```PowerShell
Start-HPCIaaSNode.ps1 –Name HPCNodeCN-*
```

## Stop compute node VMs
Stop compute nodes with the **Stop-HpcIaaSNode.ps1** script.

### Syntax
```PowerShell
Stop-HPCIaaSNode.ps1 -Name <String[]> [-Force] [<CommonParameters>]

Stop-HPCIaaSNode.ps1 -Node <Object> [-Force] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Parameters
* **Name**- Names of the cluster nodes to be stopped. Wildcards are supported. The parameter set name is Name. You cannot specify both the **Name** and **Node** parameters.
* **Node**: The HpcNode object for the nodes to be stopped, which can be obtained through the HPC PowerShell cmdlet [Get-HpcNode](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn887927.aspx). The parameter set name is Node. You cannot specify both the **Name** and **Node** parameters.
* **Force** (optional): Setting to force HPC nodes offline before stopping them.

### Example
The following example forces offline nodes with names beginning
*HPCNode-CN-* and then stops the nodes.

```PowerShell
Stop-HPCIaaSNode.ps1 –Name HPCNodeCN-* -Force
```

## Next steps
* To automatically grow or shrink the cluster nodes according to
  the current workload of jobs and tasks on the cluster, see [Automatically grow and shrink the HPC Pack cluster resources in Azure according to the cluster workload](hpcpack-cluster-node-autogrowshrink.md).
