# Troubleshoot a Windows VM by attaching the OS disk to a recovery VM using Azure PowerShell
If your Windows virtual machine (VM) in Azure encounters a boot or disk error, you may need to perform troubleshooting steps on the virtual hard disk itself. A common example would be a failed application update that prevents the VM from being able to boot successfully. This article details how to use Azure PowerShell to connect your virtual hard disk to another Windows VM to fix any errors, then re-create your original VM.


## Recovery process overview
The troubleshooting process is as follows:

1. Delete the VM encountering issues, keeping the virtual hard disks.
2. Attach and mount the virtual hard disk to another Windows VM for troubleshooting purposes.
3. Connect to the troubleshooting VM. Edit files or run any tools to fix issues on the original virtual hard disk.
4. Unmount and detach the virtual hard disk from the troubleshooting VM.
5. Create a VM using the original virtual hard disk.

For the VM that uses managed disk, see [Troubleshoot a Managed Disk VM by attaching a new OS disk](#troubleshoot-a-managed-disk-vm-by-attaching-a-new-os-disk).


Make sure that you have [the latest Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/overview) installed and logged in to your subscription:

```powershell
Connect-AzureRmAccount
```

In the following examples, replace parameter names with your own values. Example parameter names include `myResourceGroup`, `mystorageaccount`, and `myVM`.


## Determine boot issues
You can view a screenshot of your VM in Azure to help troubleshoot boot issues. This screenshot can help identify why a VM fails to boot. The following example gets the screenshot from the Windows VM named `myVM` in the resource group named `myResourceGroup`:

```powershell
Get-AzureRmVMBootDiagnosticsData -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
    -Name myVM -Windows -LocalPath C:\Users\ops\
```

Review the screenshot to determine why the VM is failing to boot. Note any specific error messages or error codes provided.


## View existing virtual hard disk details
Before you can attach your virtual hard disk to another VM, you need to identify the name of the virtual hard disk (VHD).

The following example gets information for the VM named `myVM` in the resource group named `myResourceGroup`:

```powershell
Get-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myVM"
```

Look for `Vhd URI` within the `StorageProfile` section from the output of the preceding command. The following truncated example output shows the `Vhd URI` towards the end of the code block:

```powershell
RequestId                     : 8a134642-2f01-4e08-bb12-d89b5b81a0a0
StatusCode                    : OK
ResourceGroupName             : myResourceGroup
Id                            : /subscriptions/guid/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM
Name                          : myVM
Type                          : Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
...
StorageProfile                :
  ImageReference              :
    Publisher                 : MicrosoftWindowsServer
    Offer                     : WindowsServer
    Sku                       : 2016-Datacenter
    Version                   : latest
  OsDisk                      :
    OsType                    : Windows
    Name                      : myVM
    Vhd                       :
      Uri                     : https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/vhds/myVM.vhd
    Caching                   : ReadWrite
    CreateOption              : FromImage
```


## Delete existing VM
Virtual hard disks and VMs are two distinct resources in Azure. A virtual hard disk is where the operating system itself, applications, and configurations are stored. The VM itself is just metadata that defines the size or location, and references resources such as a virtual hard disk or virtual network interface card (NIC). Each virtual hard disk has a lease assigned when attached to a VM. Although data disks can be attached and detached even while the VM is running, the OS disk cannot be detached unless the VM resource is deleted. The lease continues to associate the OS disk with a VM even when that VM is in a stopped and deallocated state.

The first step to recover your VM is to delete the VM resource itself. Deleting the VM leaves the virtual hard disks in your storage account. After the VM is deleted, you attach the virtual hard disk to another VM to troubleshoot and resolve the errors.

The following example deletes the VM named `myVM` from the resource group named `myResourceGroup`:

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myVM"
```

Wait until the VM has finished deleting before you attach the virtual hard disk to another VM. The lease on the virtual hard disk that associates it with the VM needs to be released before you can attach the virtual hard disk to another VM.


## Attach existing virtual hard disk to another VM
For the next few steps, you use another VM for troubleshooting purposes. You attach the existing virtual hard disk to this troubleshooting VM to browse and edit the disk's content. This process allows you to correct any configuration errors or review additional application or system log files, for example. Choose or create another VM to use for troubleshooting purposes.

When you attach the existing virtual hard disk, specify the URL to the disk obtained in the preceding `Get-AzureRmVM` command. The following example attaches an existing virtual hard disk to the troubleshooting VM named `myVMRecovery` in the resource group named `myResourceGroup`:

```powershell
$myVM = Get-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myVMRecovery"
Add-AzureRmVMDataDisk -VM $myVM -CreateOption "Attach" -Name "DataDisk" -DiskSizeInGB $null `
    -VhdUri "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/vhds/myVM.vhd"
Update-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroup "myResourceGroup" -VM $myVM
```

> [!NOTE]
> Adding a disk requires you to specify the size of the disk. As we attach an existing disk, the `-DiskSizeInGB` is specified as `$null`. This value ensures the data disk is correctly attached, and without the need to determine the true size of data disk.


## Mount the attached data disk

1. RDP to your troubleshooting VM using the appropriate credentials. The following example downloads the RDP connection file for the VM named `myVMRecovery` in the resource group named `myResourceGroup`, and downloads it to `C:\Users\ops\Documents`"

    ```powershell
    Get-AzureRMRemoteDesktopFile -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myVMRecovery" `
        -LocalPath "C:\Users\ops\Documents\myVMRecovery.rdp"
    ```

2. The data disk is automatically detected and attached. View the list of attached volumes to determine the drive letter as follows:

    ```powershell
    Get-Disk
    ```

    The following example output shows the virtual hard disk connected a disk **2**. (You can also use `Get-Volume` to view the drive letter):

    ```powershell
    Number   Friendly Name   Serial Number   HealthStatus   OperationalStatus   Total Size   Partition
                                                                                             Style
    ------   -------------   -------------   ------------   -----------------   ----------   ----------
    0        Virtual HD                                     Healthy             Online       127 GB MBR
    1        Virtual HD                                     Healthy             Online       50 GB MBR
    2        Msft Virtu...                                  Healthy             Online       127 GB MBR
    ```

## Fix issues on original virtual hard disk
With the existing virtual hard disk mounted, you can now perform any maintenance and troubleshooting steps as needed. Once you have addressed the issues, continue with the following steps.


## Unmount and detach original virtual hard disk
Once your errors are resolved, you unmount and detach the existing virtual hard disk from your troubleshooting VM. You cannot use your virtual hard disk with any other VM until the lease attaching the virtual hard disk to the troubleshooting VM is released.

1. From within your RDP session, unmount the data disk on your recovery VM. You need the disk number from the previous `Get-Disk` cmdlet. Then, use `Set-Disk` to set the disk as offline:

    ```powershell
    Set-Disk -Number 2 -IsOffline $True
    ```

    Confirm the disk is now set as offline using `Get-Disk` again. The following example output shows the disk is now set as offline:

    ```powershell
    Number   Friendly Name   Serial Number   HealthStatus   OperationalStatus   Total Size   Partition
                                                                                             Style
    ------   -------------   -------------   ------------   -----------------   ----------   ----------
    0        Virtual HD                                     Healthy             Online       127 GB MBR
    1        Virtual HD                                     Healthy             Online       50 GB MBR
    2        Msft Virtu...                                  Healthy             Offline      127 GB MBR
    ```

2. Exit your RDP session. From your Azure PowerShell session, remove the virtual hard disk from the troubleshooting VM.

    ```powershell
    $myVM = Get-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myVMRecovery"
    Remove-AzureRmVMDataDisk -VM $myVM -Name "DataDisk"
    Update-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroup "myResourceGroup" -VM $myVM
    ```


## Create VM from original hard disk
To create a VM from your original virtual hard disk, use [this Azure Resource Manager template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/201-vm-specialized-vhd-existing-vnet). The actual JSON template is at the following link:

- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/201-vm-specialized-vhd-existing-vnet/azuredeploy.json

The template deploys a VM into an existing virtual network, using the VHD URL from the earlier command. The following example deploys the template to the resource group named `myResourceGroup`:

```powershell
New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name myDeployment -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -TemplateUri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/201-vm-specialized-vhd-existing-vnet/azuredeploy.json
```

Answer the prompts for the template such as VM name, OS type, and VM size. The `osDiskVhdUri` is the same as previously used when attaching the existing virtual hard disk to the troubleshooting VM.


## Re-enable boot diagnostics

When you create your VM from the existing virtual hard disk, boot diagnostics may not automatically be enabled. The following example enables the diagnostic extension on the VM named `myVMDeployed` in the resource group named `myResourceGroup`:

```powershell
$myVM = Get-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myVMDeployed"
Set-AzureRmVMBootDiagnostics -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -VM $myVM -enable
Update-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroup "myResourceGroup" -VM $myVM
```

## Troubleshoot a Managed Disk VM by attaching a new OS disk
1. Stop the effected Managed Disk Windows VM.
2. [Create a managed disk snapshot](snapshot-copy-managed-disk.md) of the OS Disk of the Managed Disk VM.
3. [Create a managed disk from the snapshot](../scripts/virtual-machines-windows-powershell-sample-create-managed-disk-from-snapshot.md).
4. [Attach the managed disk as a data disk of the VM](attach-disk-ps.md).
5. [Change the data disk from step 4 to OS disk](os-disk-swap.md).
