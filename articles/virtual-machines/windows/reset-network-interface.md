6.	Change the **IP address** to another IP address that is available in the Subnet.
7.	Select Save.
8.	The virtual machine will restart to initialize the new NIC to the system.

2.	Select **View** > **Show hidden devices**.
3.	Select **Network Adapters**. 
4.	Check for the adapters named as "Microsoft Hyper-V Network Adapter".
