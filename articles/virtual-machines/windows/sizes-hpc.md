# High performance compute VM sizes

* **Operating system** - Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

* **MPI** - Microsoft MPI (MS-MPI) 2012 R2 or later, Intel MPI Library 5.x

  Supported MPI implementations use the Microsoft Network Direct interface to communicate between instances. 

* **RDMA network address space** - The RDMA network in Azure reserves the address space 172.16.0.0/16. To run MPI applications on instances deployed in an Azure virtual network, make sure that the virtual network address space does not overlap the RDMA network.

* **HpcVmDrivers VM extension** - On RDMA-capable VMs, add the HpcVmDrivers extension to install Windows network device drivers for RDMA connectivity. (In certain deployments of A8 and A9 instances, the HpcVmDrivers extension is added automatically.) To add the VM extension to a VM, you can use [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/overview) cmdlets. 

  
  The following command installs the latest version 1.1 HpcVMDrivers extension on an existing RDMA-capable VM named *myVM* deployed in the resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *West US* region:

  ```PowerShell
  Set-AzureRmVMExtension -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Location "westus" -VMName "myVM" -ExtensionName "HpcVmDrivers" -Publisher "Microsoft.HpcCompute" -Type "HpcVmDrivers" -TypeHandlerVersion "1.1"
  ```
  
  For more information, see [Virtual machine extensions and features](extensions-features.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json). You can also work with extensions for VMs deployed in the [classic deployment model](classic/manage-extensions.md).


## Using HPC Pack

[Microsoft HPC Pack](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj899572.aspx), Microsoftâ€™s free HPC cluster and job management solution, is one option for you to create a compute cluster in Azure to run Windows-based MPI applications and other HPC workloads. HPC Pack 2012 R2 and later versions include a runtime environment for MS-MPI that uses the Azure RDMA network when deployed on RDMA-capable VMs.



## Other sizes
- [General purpose](sizes-general.md)
- [Compute optimized](sizes-compute.md)
- [Memory optimized](../virtual-machines-windows-sizes-memory.md)
- [Storage optimized](../virtual-machines-windows-sizes-storage.md)
- [GPU optimized](sizes-gpu.md)
- [Previous generations](sizes-previous-gen.md)

## Next steps

- For checklists to use the compute-intensive instances with HPC Pack on Windows Server, see [Set up a Windows RDMA cluster with HPC Pack to run MPI applications](classic/hpcpack-rdma-cluster.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2fclassic%2ftoc.json).

- To use compute-intensive instances when running MPI applications with Azure Batch, see [Use multi-instance tasks to run Message Passing Interface (MPI) applications in Azure Batch](../../batch/batch-mpi.md).

- Learn more about how [Azure compute units (ACU)](acu.md) can help you compare compute performance across Azure SKUs.
