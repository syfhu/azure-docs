# Automate management tasks on Azure Virtual Machines with the SQL Server Agent Extension (Resource Manager)
> [!div class="op_single_selector"]

The SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension (SQLIaaSExtension) runs on Azure virtual machines to automate administration tasks. This article provides an overview of the services supported by the extension as well as instructions for installation, status, and removal.

[!INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../../../../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-rm-include.md)]

To view the classic version of this article, see [SQL Server Agent Extension for SQL Server VMs Classic](../sqlclassic/virtual-machines-windows-classic-sql-server-agent-extension.md).

## Supported services
The SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension supports the following administration tasks:

| Administration feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **SQL Automated Backup** |Automates the scheduling of backups for all databases for the default instance of SQL Server in the VM. For more information, see [Automated backup for SQL Server in Azure Virtual Machines (Resource Manager)](virtual-machines-windows-sql-automated-backup.md). |
| **SQL Automated Patching** |Configures a maintenance window during which important Windows updates to your VM can take place, so  you can avoid updates during peak times for your workload. For more information, see [Automated patching for SQL Server in Azure Virtual Machines (Resource Manager)](virtual-machines-windows-sql-automated-patching.md). |
| **Azure Key Vault Integration** |Enables you to automatically install and configure Azure Key Vault on your SQL Server VM. For more information, see [Configure Azure Key Vault Integration for SQL Server on Azure VMs (Resource Manager)](virtual-machines-windows-ps-sql-keyvault.md). |

Once installed and running, the SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension makes these administration features available on the SQL Server panel of the virtual machine in the Azure portal and through Azure PowerShell for SQL Server marketplace images, and through Azure PowerShell for manual installations of the extension. 

## Prerequisites
Requirements to use the SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension on your VM:

**Operating System**:

* Windows Server 2012
* Windows Server 2012 R2
* Windows Server 2016

**SQL Server versions**:

* SQL Server 2012
* SQL Server 2014
* SQL Server 2016

**Azure PowerShell**:

* [Download and configure the latest Azure PowerShell commands](/powershell/azure/overview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> At this time, the [SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension](virtual-machines-windows-sql-server-agent-extension.md) is not supported for SQL Server FCI on Azure. We recommend that you uninstall the extension from VMs that participate in an FCI. The features supported by the extension are not available to the SQL VMs after the agent is uninstalled.

## Installation
The SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension is automatically installed when you provision one of the SQL Server virtual machine gallery images. If you need to reinstall the extension manually on one of these SQL Server VMs, use the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Set-AzureRmVMSqlServerExtension -ResourceGroupName "resourcegroupname" -VMName "vmname" -Name "SQLIaasExtension" -Version "1.2" -Location "East US 2"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the extension is not already installed, installing the extension restarts the SQL Server service.

It is also possible to install the SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension on an OS-only Windows Server virtual machine. This is only supported if you have also manually installed SQL Server on that machine. Then install the extension manually by using the same **Set-AzureRmVMSqlServerExtension** PowerShell cmdlet.

> [!NOTE]
> If you manually install the SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension on an OS-only Windows Server VM, you can not manage the SQL Server configuration settings through the Azure portal. In this scenario, you must make all changes with PowerShell.

## Status
One way to verify that the extension is installed is to view the agent status in the Azure portal. Select **All settings** in the virtual machine window, and then click on **Extensions**. You should see the **SQLIaaSExtension** extension listed.

![SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension in Azure portal](./media/virtual-machines-windows-sql-server-agent-extension/azure-rm-sql-server-iaas-agent-portal.png)

You can also use the **Get-AzureRmVMSqlServerExtension** Azure PowerShell cmdlet.

    Get-AzureRmVMSqlServerExtension -VMName "vmname" -ResourceGroupName "resourcegroupname"

The previous command confirms the agent is installed and provides general status information. You can also get specific status information about Automated Backup and Patching with the following commands.

    $sqlext = Get-AzureRmVMSqlServerExtension -VMName "vmname" -ResourceGroupName "resourcegroupname"
    $sqlext.AutoPatchingSettings
    $sqlext.AutoBackupSettings

## Removal
In the Azure Portal, you can uninstall the extension by clicking the ellipsis on the **Extensions** window of your virtual machine properties. Then click **Delete**.

![Uninstall the SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension in Azure portal](./media/virtual-machines-windows-sql-server-agent-extension/azure-rm-sql-server-iaas-agent-uninstall.png)

You can also use the **Remove-AzureRmVMSqlServerExtension** PowerShell cmdlet.

    Remove-AzureRmVMSqlServerExtension -ResourceGroupName "resourcegroupname" -VMName "vmname" -Name "SQLIaasExtension"

## Next steps
Begin using one of the services supported by the extension. For more details, see the articles referenced in the [Supported services](#supported-services) section of this article.
