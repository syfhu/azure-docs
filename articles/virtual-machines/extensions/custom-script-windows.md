# Custom Script Extension for Windows

The Custom Script Extension downloads and executes scripts on Azure virtual machines. This extension is useful for post deployment configuration, software installation, or any other configuration / management task. Scripts can be downloaded from Azure storage or GitHub, or provided to the Azure portal at extension run time. The Custom Script extension integrates with Azure Resource Manager templates, and can also be run using the Azure CLI, PowerShell, Azure portal, or the Azure Virtual Machine REST API.

This document details how to use the Custom Script Extension using the Azure PowerShell module, Azure Resource Manager templates, and details troubleshooting steps on Windows systems.

## Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]  
> Do not use Custom Script Extension to run Update-AzureRmVM with the same VM as its parameter, since it will wait on itself.  
>   
> 

### Operating System

The Custom Script Extension for Linux will run on the extension supported extension OS's, for more information, see this [article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4078134/azure-extension-supported-operating-systems).

### Script Location

You can use the extension to use your Azure Blob storage credentials, to access Azure Blob storage. Alternatively, the script location can be any where, as long as the VM can route to that end point, such as GitHub, internal file server etc.


### Internet Connectivity
If you need to download a script externally such as GitHub or Azure Storage, then additional firewall/Network Security Group ports need to be opened. For example if your script is located in Azure Storage, you can allow access using Azure NSG Service Tags for [Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/security-overview#service-tags).

If your script is on a local server, then you may still need additional firewall/Network Security Group ports need to be opened.

### Tips and Tricks
* The highest failure rate for this extension is due to syntax errors in the script, test the script runs without error, and also put in additional logging into the script to make it easier to find where it failed.
* Write scripts that are idempotent, so if they get run again more than once accidentally, it will not cause system changes.
* Ensure the scripts do not require user input when they run.
* There is 90 mins allowed for the script to run, anything longer will result in a failed provision of the extension.
* Do not put reboots inside the script, this will cause issues with other extensions that are being installed, and post reboot, the extension will not continue after the restart. 
* If you have a script that will cause a reboot, then install applications and run scripts etc. You should schedule the reboot using a Windows Scheduled Task, or using tools such as DSC, or Chef, Puppet extensions.
* The extension will only run a script once, if you want to run a script on every boot, then you need to use the extension to create a Windows Scheduled Task.
* If you want to schedule when a script will run, you should use the extension to create a Windows Scheduled Task. 
* When the script is running, you will only see a 'transitioning' extension status from the Azure portal or CLI. If you want more frequent status updates of a running script, you will need to create your own solution.
* Custom Script extension does not natively support proxy servers, however you can use a file transfer tool that supports proxy servers within your script, such as *Curl* 
* Be aware of non default directory locations that your scripts or commands may rely on, have logic to handle this.


## Extension schema

The Custom Script Extension configuration specifies things like script location and the command to be run. You can store this configuration in configuration files, specify it on the command line, or specify it in an Azure Resource Manager template. 

You can store sensitive data in a protected configuration, which is encrypted and only decrypted inside the virtual machine. The protected configuration is useful when the execution command includes secrets such as a password.

These items should be treated as sensitive data and specified in the extensions protected setting configuration. Azure VM extension protected setting data is encrypted, and only decrypted on the target virtual machine.

```json
{
	"apiVersion": "2015-06-15",
	"type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions",
	"name": "config-app",
	"location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
	"dependsOn": [
		"[concat('Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/', variables('vmName'),copyindex())]",
		"[variables('musicstoresqlName')]"
	],
	"tags": {
		"displayName": "config-app"
	},
	"properties": {
		"publisher": "Microsoft.Compute",
		"type": "CustomScriptExtension",
		"typeHandlerVersion": "1.9",
		"autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true,
		"settings": {
			"fileUris": [
				"script location"
			]
		},
		"protectedSettings": {
			"commandToExecute": "myExecutionCommand",
            "storageAccountName": "myStorageAccountName",
            "storageAccountKey": "myStorageAccountKey"
		}
	}
}
```
**Note** - Only one version of an extension can be installed on a VM at a point in time, specifying custom script twice in the same Resource Manager template for the same VM will fail. 

### Property values

| Name | Value / Example | Data Type |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| apiVersion | 2015-06-15 | date |
| publisher | Microsoft.Compute | string |
| type | CustomScriptExtension | string |
| typeHandlerVersion | 1.9 | int |
| fileUris (e.g) | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/dotnet-core-sample-templates/master/dotnet-core-music-windows/scripts/configure-music-app.ps1 | array |
| commandToExecute (e.g) | powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File configure-music-app.ps1 | string |
| storageAccountName (e.g) | examplestorageacct | string |
| storageAccountKey (e.g) | TmJK/1N3AbAZ3q/+hOXoi/l73zOqsaxXDhqa9Y83/v5UpXQp2DQIBuv2Tifp60cE/OaHsJZmQZ7teQfczQj8hg== | string |

>[!NOTE]
>These property names are case-sensitive. To avoid deployment problems, use the names as shown here.

#### Property value details
 * `commandToExecute`: (**required**, string)  the entry point script to execute. Use this field instead if your command contains secrets such as passwords, or your fileUris are sensitive.
* `fileUris`: (optional, string array) the URLs for file(s) to be downloaded.
* `storageAccountName`: (optional, string) the name of storage account. If you specify storage credentials, all `fileUris` must be URLs for Azure Blobs.
* `storageAccountKey`: (optional, string) the access key of storage account

The following values can be set in either public or protected settings, the extension will reject any configuration where the values below are set in both public and protected settings.
* `commandToExecute`

Using public settings maybe useful for debugging, but it is strongly recommended that you use protected settings.

Public settings are sent in clear text to the VM where the script will be executed.  Protected settings are encrypted using a key known only to the Azure and the VM. The settings are saved to the VM as they were sent, i.e. if the settings were encrypted they are saved encrypted on the VM. The certificate used to decrypt the encrypted values is stored on the VM, and used to decrypt settings (if necessary) at runtime.

## Template deployment

Azure VM extensions can be deployed with Azure Resource Manager templates. The JSON schema detailed in the previous section can be used in an Azure Resource Manager template to run the Custom Script Extension during an Azure Resource Manager template deployment. A sample template that includes the Custom Script Extension can be found here, [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-core-sample-templates/tree/master/dotnet-core-music-windows).

## PowerShell deployment

The `Set-AzureRmVMCustomScriptExtension` command can be used to add the Custom Script extension to an existing virtual machine. For more information, see [Set-AzureRmVMCustomScriptExtension
](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.compute/v2.1.0/set-azurermvmcustomscriptextension).
```powershell
Set-AzureRmVMCustomScriptExtension -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
	-VMName myVM `
	-Location myLocation `
	-FileUri myURL `
	-Run 'myScript.ps1' `
	-Name DemoScriptExtension
```
## Further Examples

### Using Multiple Script
In this example, you have three scripts that are used to build your server, the 'commandToExecute' calls the first script, then you have options on how the others are called, for example, you can have a master script that controls the execution, with the right error handling, logging, and state management.

```powershell

$fileUri = @("https://xxxxxxx.blob.core.windows.net/buildServer1/1_Add_Tools.ps1",
"https://xxxxxxx.blob.core.windows.net/buildServer1/2_Add_Features.ps1",
"https://xxxxxxx.blob.core.windows.net/buildServer1/3_CompleteInstall.ps1")

$Settings = @{"fileUris" = $fileUri};

$storageaccname = "xxxxxxx"
$storagekey = "1234ABCD"
$ProtectedSettings = @{"storageAccountName" = $storageaccname; "storageAccountKey" = $storagekey; "commandToExecute" = "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File 1_Add_Tools.ps1"};

#run command
Set-AzureRmVMExtension -ResourceGroupName myRG `
	-Location myLocation ` 
	-VMName myVM ` 
	-Name "buildserver1" ` 
	-Publisher "Microsoft.Compute" ` 
	-ExtensionType "CustomScriptExtension" ` 
	-TypeHandlerVersion "1.9" ` 
	-Settings $Settings	` 
	-ProtectedSettings $ProtectedSettings `
```

### Running scripts from a local share
In this example you may want to use a local SMB server for your script location, note, you do not need pass in another other settings, except *commandToExecute*.

```powershell
$ProtectedSettings = @{"commandToExecute" = "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File \\filesvr\build\serverUpdate1.ps1"};
 
Set-AzureRmVMExtension -ResourceGroupName myRG 
	-Location myLocation ` 
	-VMName myVM ` 
	-Name "serverUpdate" 
	-Publisher "Microsoft.Compute" `
	-ExtensionType "CustomScriptExtension" ` 
	-TypeHandlerVersion "1.9" `
	-ProtectedSettings $ProtectedSettings

```

### How to run custom script more than once with CLI
If you want to run the custom script extension more than once, you can only do this under these conditions:
1. The extension 'Name' parameter is the same as the previous deployment of the extension.
2. You must updated the configuration otherwise the command will not re-executed, for example, you could add in a dynamic property in to the command, such as a timestamp. 

## Troubleshoot and support

### Troubleshoot

Data about the state of extension deployments can be retrieved from the Azure portal, and by using the Azure PowerShell module. To see the deployment state of extensions for a given VM, run the following command:

```powershell
Get-AzureRmVMExtension -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -VMName myVM -Name myExtensionName
```

Extension execution output is logged to files found under the following directory on the target virtual machine.
```cmd
C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\Plugins\Microsoft.Compute.CustomScriptExtension
```

The specified files are downloaded into the following directory on the target virtual machine.
```cmd
C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.Compute.CustomScriptExtension\1.*\Downloads\<n>
```
where `<n>` is a decimal integer which may change between executions of the extension.  The `1.*` value matches the actual, current `typeHandlerVersion` value of the extension.  For example, the actual directory could be `C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.Compute.CustomScriptExtension\1.8\Downloads\2`.  

When executing the `commandToExecute` command, the extension sets this directory (e.g., `...\Downloads\2`) as the current working directory. This enables the use of relative paths to locate the files downloaded via the `fileURIs` property. See the table below for examples.

Since the absolute download path may vary over time, it is better to opt for relative script/file paths in the `commandToExecute` string, whenever possible. For example:
```json
	"commandToExecute": "powershell.exe . . . -File \"./scripts/myscript.ps1\""
```

Path information after the first URI segment is retained for files downloaded via the `fileUris` property list.  As shown in the table below, downloaded files are mapped into download subdirectories to reflect the structure of the `fileUris` values.  

#### Examples of Downloaded Files

| URI in fileUris | Relative downloaded location | Absolute downloaded location * |
| ---- | ------- |:--- |
| `https://someAcct.blob.core.windows.net/aContainer/scripts/myscript.ps1` | `./scripts/myscript.ps1` |`C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.Compute.CustomScriptExtension\1.8\Downloads\2\scripts\myscript.ps1`  |
| `https://someAcct.blob.core.windows.net/aContainer/topLevel.ps1` | `./topLevel.ps1` | `C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.Compute.CustomScriptExtension\1.8\Downloads\2\topLevel.ps1` |

\* As above, the absolute directory paths change over the lifetime of the VM, but not within a single execution of the CustomScript extension.
