> [!NOTE]
> Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources:  [Resource Manager and classic](../resource-manager-deployment-model.md). This article covers using the Resource Manager deployment model, which Microsoft recommends for most new deployments instead of the classic deployment model.

## Create a VM with a static public IP

To create a VM with a static public IP address in the Azure portal, complete the following steps:

1. From a browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and, if necessary, sign in with your Azure account.
2. On the top left-hand corner of the portal, click **Create a resource**>>**Compute**>**Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter**.
3. In the **Select a deployment model** list, select **Resource Manager** and click **Create**.
4. In the **Basics** pane, enter the VM information as follows, and then click **OK**.

5. In the **Choose a size** pane, click **A1 Standard** as follows, and then click **Select**.

6. In the **Settings** pane, click **Public IP address**, then in the **Create public IP address** pane, under **Assignment**, click **Static** as follows. And, then click **OK**.

7. In the **Settings** pane, click **OK**.
8. Review the **Summary** pane, as follows, and then click **OK**.

9. Notice the new tile in your dashboard.

10. Once the VM is created, the **Settings** pane displays as follows:

## Set IP addresses within the operating system

You should never manually assign the public IP address assigned to an Azure virtual machine within the virtual machine's operating system. Itâ€™s recommended that you do not statically assign the private IP assigned to the Azure virtual machine within the operating system of a VM, unless necessary, such as when [assigning multiple IP addresses to a Windows VM](virtual-network-multiple-ip-addresses-portal.md). If you do manually set the private IP address within the operating system, ensure that it is the same address as the private IP address assigned to the Azure [network interface](virtual-network-network-interface-addresses.md#change-ip-address-settings), or you can lose connectivity to the virtual machine. Learn more about [private IP address](virtual-network-network-interface-addresses.md#private) settings.

## Next steps

Any network traffic can flow to and from the VM created in this article. You can define inbound and outbound security rules within a network security group that limit the traffic that can flow to and from the network interface, the subnet, or both. To learn more about network security groups, see [Network security group overview](security-overview.md).
