Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources: [Resource Manager and classic](../resource-manager-deployment-model.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json). This article covers using the Resource Manager deployment model, which Microsoft recommends for most new deployments instead of the classic deployment model.

[!INCLUDE [virtual-network-deploy-static-pip-scenario-include.md](../../includes/virtual-network-deploy-static-pip-scenario-include.md)]

## <a name = "create"></a>Create the VM

The values in "" for the variables in the steps that follow create resources with settings from the scenario. Change the values, as appropriate, for your environment.

1. Install the [Azure CLI 2.0](/cli/azure/install-az-cli2) if you don't already have it installed.
2. Create an SSH public and private key pair for Linux VMs by completing the steps in the [Create an SSH public and private key pair for Linux VMs](../virtual-machines/linux/mac-create-ssh-keys.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).
3. From a command shell, login with the command `az login`.
4. Create the VM by executing the script that follows on a Linux or Mac computer. The Azure public IP address, virtual network, network interface, and VM resources must all exist in the same location. Though the resources don't all have to exist in the same resource group, in the following script they do.

```bash
RgName="IaaSStory"
Location="westus"

# Create a resource group.

az group create \
--name $RgName \
--location $Location

# Create a public IP address resource with a static IP address using the --allocation-method Static option.
# If you do not specify this option, the address is allocated dynamically. The address is assigned to the
# resource from a pool of IP adresses unique to each Azure region. The DnsName must be unique within the
# Azure location it's created in. Download and view the file from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41653#
# that lists the ranges for each region.

PipName="PIPWEB1"
DnsName="iaasstoryws1"
az network public-ip create \
--name $PipName \
--resource-group $RgName \
--location $Location \
--allocation-method Static \
--dns-name $DnsName

# Create a virtual network with one subnet

VnetName="TestVNet"
VnetPrefix="192.168.0.0/16"
SubnetName="FrontEnd"
SubnetPrefix="192.168.1.0/24"
az network vnet create \
--name $VnetName \
--resource-group $RgName \
--location $Location \
--address-prefix $VnetPrefix \
--subnet-name $SubnetName \
--subnet-prefix $SubnetPrefix

# Create a network interface connected to the VNet with a static private IP address and associate the public IP address
# resource to the NIC.

NicName="NICWEB1"
PrivateIpAddress="192.168.1.101"
az network nic create \
--name $NicName \
--resource-group $RgName \
--location $Location \
--subnet $SubnetName \
--vnet-name $VnetName \
--private-ip-address $PrivateIpAddress \
--public-ip-address $PipName

# Create a new VM with the NIC

VmName="WEB1"

# Replace the value for the VmSize variable with a value from the
# https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-sizes article.
VmSize="Standard_DS1"

# Replace the value for the OsImage variable with a value for *urn* from the output returned by entering
# the `az vm image list` command. 

OsImage="credativ:Debian:8:latest"
Username='adminuser'

# Replace the following value with the path to your public key file.
SshKeyValue="~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

az vm create \
--name $VmName \
--resource-group $RgName \
--image $OsImage \
--location $Location \
--size $VmSize \
--nics $NicName \
--admin-username $Username \
--ssh-key-value $SshKeyValue
# If creating a Windows VM, remove the previous line and you'll be prompted for the password you want to configure for the VM.
```

In addition to creating a VM, the script creates:
- A single premium managed disk by default, but you have other options for the disk type you can create. Read the [Create a Linux VM using the Azure CLI 2.0](../virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-cli.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) article for details.
- Virtual network, subnet, NIC, and public IP address resources. Alternatively, you can use *existing* virtual network, subnet, NIC, or public IP address resources. To learn how to use existing network resources rather than creating additional resources, enter `az vm create -h`.

## <a name = "validate"></a>Validate VM creation and public IP address

1. Enter the command `az resource list --resouce-group IaaSStory --output table` to see a list of the resources created by the script. There should be five resources in the returned output: network interface, disk, public IP address, virtual network, and a virtual machine.
2. Enter the command `az network public-ip show --name PIPWEB1 --resource-group IaaSStory --output table`. In the returned output, note the value of **IpAddress** and that the value of **PublicIpAllocationMethod** is *Static*.
3. Before executing the following command, remove the <>, replace *Username* with the name you used for the **Username** variable in the script, and replace *ipAddress* with the **ipAddress** from the previous step. Run the following command to connect to the VM: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/azure_id_rsa <Username>@<ipAddress>`. 

## <a name= "clean-up"></a>Remove the VM and associated resources

It's recommended that you delete the resources created in this exercise if you won't use them in production. VM, public IP address, and disk resources incur charges, as long as they're provisioned. To remove the resources created during this exercise, complete the following steps:

1. To view the resources in the resource group, run the `az resource list --resource-group IaaSStory` command.
2. Confirm there are no resources in the resource group, other than the resources created by the script in this article. 
3. To delete all resources created in this exercise, run the `az group delete -n IaaSStory` command. The command deletes the resource group and all the resources it contains.
 
## Set IP addresses within the operating system

You should never manually assign the public IP address assigned to an Azure virtual machine within the virtual machine's operating system. Itâ€™s recommended that you do not statically assign the private IP assigned to the Azure virtual machine within the operating system of a VM, unless necessary, such as when [assigning multiple IP addresses to a Windows VM](virtual-network-multiple-ip-addresses-cli.md). If you do manually set the private IP address within the operating system, ensure that it is the same address as the private IP address assigned to the Azure [network interface](virtual-network-network-interface-addresses.md#change-ip-address-settings), or you can lose connectivity to the virtual machine. Learn more about [private IP address](virtual-network-network-interface-addresses.md#private) settings.

## Next steps

Any network traffic can flow to and from the VM created in this article. You can define inbound and outbound security rules within a network security group that limit the traffic that can flow to and from the network interface, the subnet, or both. To learn more about network security groups, see [Network security group overview](security-overview.md).
