# Create reviews from the API console

Use the Review API's [review operations](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/580519463f9b070e5c591178/operations/580519483f9b0709fc47f9c4) to create image or text reviews for human moderation. Human moderators use the Review tool to review the content. Use this operation based on your post-moderation business logic. Use it after you have scanned your content by using any of the Content Moderator image or text APIs, or other Cognitive Services APIs. 

After a human moderator reviews the auto-assigned tags and prediction data and submits a final moderation decision, the Review API submits all information to your API endpoint.

## Use the API console
To test-drive the API by using the online console, you need a few values to enter into the console:

- **teamName**: The team name that you created when you set up your Review tool account. 
- **ContentId**: This string is passed to the API and returned through the callback. The ContentId is useful for associating internal identifiers or metadata with the results of a moderation job.
- **Metadata**: Custom key-value pairs returned to your API endpoint during the callback. If the key is a short code that is defined in the Review tool, it appears as a tag.
- **Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key**: Located on the **Settings** tab. For more information, see [Overview](overview.md).

The simplest way to access a testing console is from the **Credentials** window.

1.	In the **Credentials** window, select [Review API reference](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/580519463f9b070e5c591178/operations/580519483f9b0709fc47f9c4).

  The **Review - Create** page opens.

2.	For **Open API testing console**, select the region that most closely describes your location.

  The **Review - Create** API console opens.
  
3.	Enter values for the required query parameters, content type, and your subscription key. In the **Request body** box, specify the content (for example, image location), metadata, and other information associated with the content.

5.	Select **Get**, and then open the API by selecting the button that matches your region. On the resulting page, enter the values for **teamName**, **ReviewID**, and **subscription key**. Select the **Send** button on the page.
