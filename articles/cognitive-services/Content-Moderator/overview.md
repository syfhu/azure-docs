# What is Content Moderator?

Content moderation is the process of monitoring for possible offensive, undesirable, and risky content. The moderated content can be images, text, and videos.

## Where it is used

The following list shows a few example scenarios where Content Moderator is used:

- Online marketplaces moderating product catalogs and user generated content
- Gaming companies moderating user generated game artifacts and chat rooms
- Social messaging platform moderating images, text, and videos added by their users
- Enterprise media companies implementing centralized content moderation for their content
- K-12 education solution providers filtering bad and offensive content for students and educators

## What it includes

Content Moderator consists of several web service APIs and a built-in human-in-the-loop review tool that help moderate images, text, and videos.

## APIs

Content Moderator includes the following APIs:
  - [**Text moderation API**](text-moderation-api.md): Use this API to scan text for possible profanity, explicit, suggestive, offensive, and personally identifiable information (PII).
  - [**Custom term list API**](try-terms-list-api.md): Use this API to match against custom lists of terms in addition to the built-in terms. Use these lists to block or allow content as per your content policies.  
  - [**Image moderation API**](image-moderation-api.md): Use this API to scan images for adult and racy content, detect text in images with the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability, and detect faces.
  - [**Custom image list API**](try-image-list-api.md): Use this API to match against custom lists of images, pre-identified content that you donâ€™t need to classify again.
  - [**Video moderation API**](video-moderation-api.md): Use this API to scan videos for potential adult and racy content.
  - [**Review APIs**](try-review-api-job.md): Use the [Jobs](try-review-api-job.md), [Reviews](try-review-api-review.md), and [Workflow](try-review-api-workflow.md) operations to create and automate human-in-the-loop workflows within the review tool.

## Human review tool

Your Content Moderator subscription includes the built-in [human review tool](Review-Tool-User-Guide/human-in-the-loop.md). Use the previously mentioned Review API to create reviews of text, images, and videos for your human moderators to take final decisions.
