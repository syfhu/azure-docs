# Supported languages in the Microsoft Translator Text API

The Microsoft Translator Text API supports the following languages for text to text translation. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is the new standard for high-quality AI-powered machine translations and is available as the default using V3 of the Translator Text API when a neural system is available. Neural machine translation is available in V2 by using the "generalnn" category.
