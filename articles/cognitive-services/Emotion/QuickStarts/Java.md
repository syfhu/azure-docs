# Emotion API Java for Android Quick Start

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Video API Preview will end on October 30th, 2017. Try the new [Video Indexer API Preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/video-indexer/) to easily extract insights from 
videos and to enhance content discovery experiences, such as search results, by detecting spoken words, faces, characters, and emotions. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/video-indexer/video-indexer-overview).

This article provides information and a code sample to help you quickly get started with the [Emotion Recognize method](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5639d931ca73072154c1ce89/operations/563b31ea778daf121cc3a5fa) in the Emotion API Android client library. The sample demonstrates how you can use Java to recognize the emotions expressed by people. 

## Prerequisites
* Get the Emotion API Java for Android SDK [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-emotion-android)
* Get your free subscription key [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/)

## Recognize Emotions Java for Android Example Request

```java
// // This sample uses the Apache HTTP client from HTTP Components (http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/)
import java.net.URI;
import org.apache.http.HttpEntity;
import org.apache.http.HttpResponse;
import org.apache.http.client.HttpClient;
import org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpPost;
import org.apache.http.entity.StringEntity;
import org.apache.http.client.utils.URIBuilder;
import org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultHttpClient;
import org.apache.http.util.EntityUtils;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        HttpClient httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient();

        try
        {
            // NOTE: You must use the same region in your REST call as you used to obtain your subscription keys.
            //   For example, if you obtained your subscription keys from westcentralus, replace "westus" in the 
            //   URL below with "westcentralus".
            URIBuilder uriBuilder = new URIBuilder("https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/emotion/v1.0/recognize");

            URI uri = uriBuilder.build();
            HttpPost request = new HttpPost(uri);

            // Request headers. Replace the example key below with your valid subscription key.
            request.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
            request.setHeader("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", "13hc77781f7e4b19b5fcdd72a8df7156");

            // Request body. Replace the example URL below with the URL of the image you want to analyze.
            StringEntity reqEntity = new StringEntity("{ \"url\": \"http://example.com/images/test.jpg\" }");
            request.setEntity(reqEntity);

            HttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(request);
            HttpEntity entity = response.getEntity();

            if (entity != null)
            {
                System.out.println(EntityUtils.toString(entity));
            }
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

## Recognize Emotions Sample Response
A successful call returns an array of face entries and their associated emotion scores, ranked by face rectangle size in descending order. An empty response indicates that no faces were detected. An emotion entry contains the following fields:
* faceRectangle - Rectangle location of face in the image.
* scores - Emotion scores for each face in the image. 

```json
application/json 
[
  {
    "faceRectangle": {
      "left": 68,
      "top": 97,
      "width": 64,
      "height": 97
    },
    "scores": {
      "anger": 0.00300731952,
      "contempt": 5.14648448E-08,
      "disgust": 9.180124E-06,
      "fear": 0.0001912825,
      "happiness": 0.9875571,
      "neutral": 0.0009861537,

  }
