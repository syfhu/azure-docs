## Access the list programmatically

You can access the list of supported languages programmatically using the languages resource. The list provides the language code as well as the language name in English, or any other supported language. This list is automatically updated by the Microsoft Translator service as new languages become available.

The Languages resource returns the list of supported languages for speech, text, and text to speech. The Languages resource does not require authentication.

[Visit the API reference to try out the languages method](languages-reference.md)

## Access the list on the Microsoft Translator website

For a quick look at the languages, the Microsoft Translator website shows all the languages supported by the Translator Text and Speech APIs. This list does not include developer-specific information such as language codes.
