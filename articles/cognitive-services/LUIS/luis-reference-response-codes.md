# LUIS API HTTP response codes
The [authoring](https://aka.ms/luis-authoring-apis) and [endpoint](https://aka.ms/luis-endpoint-apis) APIs return HTTP response codes. While response messages include information specific to a request, the HTTP response status code is general. 

## Common status codes
The following table lists some of the most common HTTP response status codes for the [authoring](https://aka.ms/luis-authoring-apis) and [endpoint](https://aka.ms/luis-endpoint-apis) APIs:
