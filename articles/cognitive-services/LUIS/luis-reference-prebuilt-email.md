# Email entity
Email extraction includes the entire email address from an utterance. Because this entity is already trained, you do not need to add example utterances containing email to the application intents. Email entity is supported in `en-us` culture only. 

## Resolution for prebuilt email
The following example shows the resolution of the **builtin.email** entity.

```JSON
{
  "query": "please send the information to patti.owens@microsoft.com",
  "topScoringIntent": {
    "intent": "None",
    "score": 0.811592042
  },
  "intents": [
    {
      "intent": "None",
      "score": 0.811592042
    }
  ],
  "entities": [
    {
      "entity": "patti.owens@microsoft.com",
      "type": "builtin.email",
      "startIndex": 31,
      "endIndex": 55
    }
  ]
}
```
