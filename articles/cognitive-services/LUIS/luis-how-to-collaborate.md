# Collaborate with others on Language Understanding (LUIS) apps  

You can collaborate with others on your LUIS app together. 

## Owner and collaborators
An app has a single owner but can have many collaborators. 

## Add collaborator

To allow collaborators to edit your LUIS app, on the **Settings** page of your LUIS app, enter the email of the collaborator and click **Add collaborator**.

* Collaborators can sign in and edit your LUIS app at the same time you are working on the app. <!--If a collaborator edits the LUIS app, you see a notification at the top of the browser.-->
* Collaborators cannot add other collaborators.

See [Azure Active Directory tenant user](luis-how-to-account-settings.md#azure-active-directory-tenant-user) to learn more about Active Directory user accounts. 

## Set application as public
See [Public app endpoint access](luis-concept-security.md#public-app-endpoint-access) for more information.

### Transfer of ownership
While LUIS doesn't currently support transfer of ownership, you can export your app, and another LUIS user can import the app. There may be minor differences in LUIS scores between the two applications.
