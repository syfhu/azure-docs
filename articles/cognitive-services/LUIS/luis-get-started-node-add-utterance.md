#Customer intent: As a developer new to LUIS, I want to add an utterance to the LUIS app model using Node.js.

# Quickstart: Add utterances app using Node.js 
In this quickstart, you write a program to add an utterance to an intent using the Authoring APIs in Node.js.

<!-- green checkmark -->
<!--
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create Visual Studio console project 
> * Add method to call LUIS API to add utterance and train app
> * Add JSON file with example utterances for BookFlight intent
> * Run console and see training status for utterances
-->

For more information, 
refer to the technical documentation for the [add example utterance to intent](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5890b47c39e2bb17b84a55ff/operations/5890b47c39e2bb052c5b9c08), [train](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5890b47c39e2bb17b84a55ff/operations/5890b47c39e2bb052c5b9c45), and [training status](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5890b47c39e2bb17b84a55ff/operations/5890b47c39e2bb052c5b9c46) APIs.

For this article, you need a free [LUIS][LUIS] account in order to author your LUIS application.

## Prerequisites

* Latest [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) with NPM.
* NPM dependencies for this article: [**request**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request), [**request-promise**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-promise), [**fs-extra**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra).  
* **[Recommended]** [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for IntelliSense and debugging.
* Your LUIS **[authoring key](luis-concept-keys.md#authoring-key)**. You can find this key under Account Settings in the [LUIS](luis-reference-regions.md) website.
* Your existing LUIS [**application ID**](./luis-get-started-create-app.md). The application ID is shown in the application dashboard. The LUIS application with the intents and entities used in the `utterances.json` file must exist prior to running the code in `add-utterances.js`. The code in this article will not create the intents and entities. It will only add the utterances for existing intents and entities. 
* The **version ID** within the application that receives the utterances. The default ID is "0.1"
* Create a new file named `add-utterances.js` project in VSCode.

> [!NOTE] 
> The complete `add-utterances.js` file is available from the [**LUIS-Samples** Github repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/LUIS-Samples/tree/master/examples/add-utterances/nodejs).


## Write the Node.js code

Add the NPM dependencies to the file.

   [!code-javascript[NPM Dependencies](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/authoring-api-samples/node/add-utterances.js?range=16-19 "NPM Dependencies")]

Add the LUIS constants to the file. Copy the following code and change to your authoring key, application ID, and version ID.

   [!code-javascript[LUIS key and IDs](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/authoring-api-samples/node/add-utterances.js?range=22-29 "LUIS key and IDs")]

Add the name and location of the upload file containing your utterances. 

   [!code-javascript[Add upload file](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/authoring-api-samples/node/add-utterances.js?range=31-33 "Add upload file")]

Add the variables that hold the command-line values.

   [!code-javascript[Add upload file](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/authoring-api-samples/node/add-utterances.js?range=35-49 "Add upload file")]


Add the function `sendUtteranceToApi` to send and receive HTTP calls. 

   [!code-javascript[Send the HTTP request](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/authoring-api-samples/node/add-utterances.js?range=135-151 "Send the HTTP request")]

Add the configuration JSON object used by the `addUtterance` function.

   [!code-javascript[Add configuration information for adding utterance](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/authoring-api-samples/node/add-utterances.js?range=52-59 "Add configuration information for adding utterance")]

Add the function `addUtterance` manage the API request and response used by `SendUtteranceToApp`.

   [!code-javascript[Add configuration information for adding utterance](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/authoring-api-samples/node/add-utterances.js?range=62-92 "Add configuration information for adding utterance")]

Add the configuration JSON object used by the `train` function.

   [!code-javascript[Add configuration information for training LUIS](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/authoring-api-samples/node/add-utterances.js?range=94-101 "Add configuration information for training LUIS")]

Add the function `train` to start the training process. 

   [!code-javascript[Train the application](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/authoring-api-samples/node/add-utterances.js?range=103-133 "Train the application")]

Add the code that chooses which action to take (add utterance or train) based on the command-line variables.

   [!code-javascript[Train the application](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/authoring-api-samples/node/add-utterances.js?range=153-184 "Train the application")]

## Specify utterances to add
Create and edit the file `utterances.json` to specify the **array of utterances** you want to add to the LUIS app. The intent and entities **must** already be in the LUIS app.

> [!NOTE]
> The LUIS application with the intents and entities used in the `utterances.json` file must exist prior to running the code in `add-utterances.js`. The code in this article will not create the intents and entities. It will only add the utterances for existing intents and entities.

The `text` field contains the text of the utterance. The `intentName` field must correspond to the name of an intent in the LUIS app. The `entityLabels` field is required. If you don't want to label any entities, provide an empty list as shown in the following example.

If the entityLabels list is not empty, the `startCharIndex` and `endCharIndex` need to mark the entity referred to in the `entityName` field. Both indexes are zero-based counts meaning 6 in the top example refers to the "S" of Seattle and not the space before the capital S.

```json
[
    {
        "text": "go to Seattle",
        "intentName": "BookFlight",
        "entityLabels": [
            {
                "entityName": "Location::LocationTo",
                "startCharIndex": 6,
                "endCharIndex": 12
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "text": "book a flight",
        "intentName": "BookFlight",
        "entityLabels": []
    }
]
```

## Add an utterance from the command-line

Run the application from a command-line with Node.js.

Calling add-utterance with no arguments adds an utterance to the app, without training it.
````
> node add-utterances.js
````

This sample creates a file with the `results.json` that contains the results from calling the add utterances API. The `response` field is in this format for utterances that was added. The `hasError` is false, indicating the utterance was added.  

```json
    "response": [
        {
            "value": {
                "UtteranceText": "go to seattle",
                "ExampleId": -5123383
            },
            "hasError": false
        },
        {
            "value": {
                "UtteranceText": "book a flight",
                "ExampleId": -169157
            },
            "hasError": false
        }
    ]
```

## Add an utterance and train from the command-line
Call add-utterance with the `-train` argument to send a request to train, and subsequently request training status. The status is queued immediately after training begins. Status details are written to a file.

````
> node add-utterances.js -train
````

> [!NOTE]
> Duplicate utterances aren't added again, but don't cause an error. The `response` contains the ID of the original utterance.

When you call the sample with the `-train` argument, it creates a `training-results.json` file indicating the request to train the LUIS app was successfully queued. 

The following shows the result of a successful request to train:
```json
{
    "request": null,
    "response": {
        "statusId": 9,
        "status": "Queued"
    }
}
```

After the request to train is queued, it can take a moment to complete training.

## Get training status from the command line
Call the sample with the `-status` argument to check the training status and write status details to a file.

````
> node add-utterances.js -status
````

## Clean up resources
When you are done with the tutorial, remove Visual Studio and the console application if you don't need them anymore.
