# Web App Bot using the LUIS template for C#

Build a chatbot with integrated language understanding.

## Prerequisite

* [HomeAutomation LUIS app](luis-get-started-create-app.md). The intents from this LUIS app map to the bot's dialog handlers. 

## LUIS HomeAutomation Intents

| Intent | Example utterance | Bot functionality |
|:----:|:----------:|---|
| HomeAutomation.TurnOn | Turn on the lights. | When the LUIS intent `HomeAutomation.TurnOn` is detected, the bot invokes the `OnIntent` dialog handler. This dialog is where you'd call an IoT service to turn on a device and tell the user that the device has been turned on. |
| HomeAutomation.TurnOff | Turn off the bedroom lights. | When the LUIS intent `HomeAutomation.TurnOff` is detected, the bot invokes the `OffIntent` dialog handler. This dialog is where you'd call an IoT service to turn off a device and tell the user that the device has been turned off. |

## Create a Language Understanding bot with Bot Service

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Create new resource** in the top left menu.

    ![Create new resource](./media/luis-tutorial-cscharp-web-bot/bot-service-creation.png)

2. In the search box, search for **Web App Bot**. 

    ![Create new resource](./media/luis-tutorial-cscharp-web-bot/bot-service-selection.png)

3. In the Web App Bot window, click **Create**.

4. In **Bot Service**, provide the required information, and click **Create**. This creates and deploys the bot service and LUIS app to Azure. If you want to use [speech priming](https://docs.microsoft.com/bot-framework/bot-service-manage-speech-priming), review [region requirements](luis-resources-faq.md#what-luis-regions-support-bot-framework-speech-priming) before creating your bot. 
    * Set **App name** to your botâ€™s name. The name is used as the subdomain when your bot is deployed to the cloud (for example, mynotesbot.azurewebsites.net). <!-- This name is also used as the name of the LUIS app associated with your bot. Copy it to use later, to find the LUIS app associated with the bot. -->
    * Select the subscription, [resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview), App service plan, and [location](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/).
    * Select the **Language understanding (C#)** template for the **Bot template** field.
    * Select the **LUIS App Location**. This is the authoring [region][LUIS] the app is created in.
    * Select the confirmation checkbox for the legal notice. The terms of the legal notice are below the checkbox.

    ![Bot Service](./media/luis-tutorial-cscharp-web-bot/bot-service-setting-callout-template.png)


5. Confirm that the bot service has been deployed.
    * Click Notifications (the bell icon that is located along the top edge of the Azure portal). The notification changes from **Deployment started** to **Deployment succeeded**.
    * After the notification changes to **Deployment succeeded**, click **Go to resource** on that notification.

> [!Note]
> This web app bot creation process also created a new LUIS app for you. It has been trained and published for you. 

## Try the default bot

Confirm that the bot has been deployed by selecting the **Notifications** checkbox. The notifications changes from **Deployment in progress...** to **Deployment succeeded**. Click **Go to resource** button to open the bot's resources.

Once the bot is deployed, click **Test in Web Chat** to open the Web Chat pane. Type "hello" in Web Chat.

  ![Test the bot in Web Chat](./media/luis-tutorial-cscharp-web-bot/bot-service-web-chat.png)

The bot responds by saying "You have reached Greeting. You said: hello".  This response confirms that the bot has received your message and passed it to a default LUIS app that it created. This default LUIS app detected a Greeting intent. In the next step, you'll connect the bot to the LUIS app you previously created instead of the default LUIS app.

## Connect your LUIS app to the bot

Open **Application Settings** and edit the **LuisAppId** field to contain the application ID of your LUIS app. If you created your HomeAutomation LUIS app in a region other than West US, you need to change the **LuisAPIHostName** as well. The **LuisAPIKey** is currently set to your authoring key. You change this to your endpoint key when your traffic exceeds the free tier quota. 

  ![Update the LUIS app ID in Azure](./media/luis-tutorial-cscharp-web-bot/bot-service-app-settings.png)

> [!Note]
> If you don't have the LUIS app ID of the [Home Automation app](luis-get-started-create-app.md), log in to the [LUIS](luis-reference-regions.md) website using the same account you use to log in to Azure. 
> 1. Click on **My apps**. 
> 2. Find the LUIS app you previously created, that contains the intents and entities from the HomeAutomation domain.
> 3. In the **Settings** page for the LUIS app, find and copy the app ID. Make sure it is [trained](interactive-test.md) and [published](luis-how-to-publish-app.md). 

    > [!WARNING]
    > If you delete your app ID or LUIS key, the bot will stop working.

## Modify the bot code

1. Click **Build** and then click **Open online code editor**.

   ![Open online code editor](./media/luis-tutorial-cscharp-web-bot/bot-service-build.png)

2. Right click `build.cmd` and choose **Run from Console** to build the app. There are several build steps the service completes automatically for you. The build is complete when it finished with "Finished successfully."

3. In the code editor, open `/Dialogs/BasicLuisDialog.cs`. It contains the following code:

   [!code-csharp[Default BasicLuisDialog.cs](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/tutorial-web-app-bot/csharp/Default_BasicLuisDialog.cs "Default BasicLuisDialog.cs")]

## Change code to HomeAutomation intents


1. Remove the three intent attributes and methods for **Greeting**, **Cancel**, and **Help**. These intents are not used in the HomeAutomation prebuilt domain. Make sure to keep the **None** intent attribute and method. 

2. Add dependencies to the top of the file, with the other dependencies:

   [!code-csharp[Dependencies](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/tutorial-web-app-bot/csharp/BasicLuisDialog.cs?range=4-5&dedent=8 "dependencies")]

3. Add constants to manage strings at the top of the `BasicLuisDialog ` class:

   [!code-csharp[Add Intent and Entity Constants](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/tutorial-web-app-bot/csharp/BasicLuisDialog.cs?range=23-32&dedent=8 "Add Intent and Entity Constants")]

4. Add the code for the new intents of `HomeAutomation.TurnOn` and `HomeAutomation.TurnOff` inside the `BasicLuisDialog ` class:

   [!code-csharp[Add Intents](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/tutorial-web-app-bot/csharp/BasicLuisDialog.cs?range=61-71&dedent=8 "Add Intents")]

5. Add the code to get any entities found by LUIS inside the `BasicLuisDialog ` class:

   [!code-csharp[Collect entities](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/tutorial-web-app-bot/csharp/BasicLuisDialog.cs?range=34-53&dedent=8 "Collect entities")]

6. Change **ShowLuisResult** method in the `BasicLuisDialog ` class to round the score, collect the entities, and display the response message in the chatbot:

   [!code-csharp[Display message in chatbot](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/tutorial-web-app-bot/csharp/BasicLuisDialog.cs?range=73-83&dedent=8 "Display message in chatbot")]

## Build the bot
In the code editor, right-click on `build.cmd` and select **Run from Console**.

![Build Web bot ](./media/luis-tutorial-cscharp-web-bot/bot-service-build-run-from-console.png)

The code view is replaced with a terminal window showing the progress and results of the build.

![Build Web bot success](./media/luis-tutorial-cscharp-web-bot/bot-service-build-success.png)

> [!TIP]
> An alternative method to build the bot is to select the bot name in the top blue bar, and select **Open Kudu Console**. The console opens to **D:\home**. 
> 
> Change the directory to **D:\home\site\wwwroot** by typing:
> `cd site\wwwroot`
>
> Run the build script by typing:
> `build.cmd`

## Test the bot

In the Azure portal, click on **Test in Web Chat** to test the bot. Type messages like "Turn on the lights", and "turn off my heater" to invoke the intents that you added to it.

   ![Test HomeAutomation bot in Web Chat](./media/luis-tutorial-cscharp-web-bot/bot-service-chat-results.png)

> [!TIP]
> You can retrain your LUIS app without any modification to your bot's code. See [Add example utterances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/LUIS/add-example-utterances) and [train and test your LUIS app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/LUIS/interactive-test). 

## Download the bot to debug
If your bot isn't working, download the project to your local machine and continue [debugging](https://docs.microsoft.com/bot-framework/bot-service-debug-bot#debug-an-azure-app-service-web-app-c-bot). 

## Learn more about Bot Framework
Learn more about [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) and the [3.x](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder) and [4.x](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet) SDKs.

## Next steps

Add the LUIS intents and Bot service dialogs for handling **Help**, **Cancel**, and **Greeting** intents. Remember to train, publish and to [build](#build-the-bot) the web app bot. Both LUIS and the bot should have the same intents.
