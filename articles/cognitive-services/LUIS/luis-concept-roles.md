# Entity roles in Patterns are contextual subtypes
Roles are named, contextual subtypes of an entity used only in [patterns](luis-concept-patterns.md).

For example, in the utterance `buy a ticket from New York to London`, both New York and London are cities but each has a different meaning in the sentence. New York is the origin city and London is the destination city. 

Roles give a name to those differences:

|Entity|Role|Purpose|
|--|--|--|
|Location|origin|where the plane leaves from|
|Location|destination|where the plane lands|

## How are roles used in patterns?
In a pattern's template utterance, roles are used within the utterance: 

```
buy a ticket from {Location:origin} to {Location:destination}
```

## Role syntax in patterns
The entity and role are surrounded in parentheses, `{}`. The entity and the role are separated by a colon. 

## Roles versus Hierarchical entities
Hierarchical entities provide the same contextual information as roles but only to utterances in **intents**. Similarly, roles provide the same contextual information as hierarchical entities but only in **patterns**.

|Contextual learning|Used in|

|hierarchical entities|intents|
