For this article, you need a free [LUIS](luis-reference-regions.md#luis-website) account in order to author your LUIS application.

## Before you begin
If you do not have the Human Resources app from the [prebuilt entities](luis-tutorial-prebuilt-intents-entities.md) tutorial, [import](create-new-app.md#import-new-app) the JSON into a new app in the [LUIS](luis-reference-regions.md#luis-website) website, from the [LUIS-Samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/LUIS-Samples/blob/master/documentation-samples/quickstarts/custom-domain-prebuilts-HumanResources.json) Github repository.

If you want to keep the original Human Resources app, clone the version on the [Settings](luis-how-to-manage-versions.md#clone-a-version) page, and name it `regex`. Cloning is a great way to play with various LUIS features without affecting the original version. 


## Purpose of the regular expression entity
The purpose of an entity is to get important data contained in the utterance. The app's use of the regular expression entity is to pull out formatted Human Resources (HR) Form numbers from an utterance. It is not machine-learned. 

Simple example utterances include:

```
Where is HRF-123456?
Who authored HRF-123234?
HRF-456098 is published in French?
```

Abbreviated or slang versions of utterances include:

```
HRF-456098
HRF-456098 date?
HRF-456098 title?
```
 
The regular expression entity to match the form number is `hrf-[0-9]{6}`. This regular expression matches the literal characters `hrf -` but ignores case and culture variants. It matches digits 0-9, for 6 digits exactly.

HRF stands for human resources form.

### Tokenization with hyphens
LUIS tokenizes the utterance when the utterance is added to an intent. The tokenization for these utterances adds spaces before and after the hyphen, `Where is HRF - 123456?`  The regular expression is applied to the utterance in its raw form, before it is tokenized. Because it is applied to the _raw_ form, the regular expression doesn't have to deal with word boundaries. 


## Add FindForm intent

1. Make sure your Human Resources app is in the **Build** section of LUIS. You can change to this section by selecting **Build** on the top, right menu bar. 

    [ ![Screenshot of LUIS app with Build hightlighted in top, right navigation bar](./media/luis-quickstart-intents-regex-entity/first-image.png)](./media/luis-quickstart-intents-regex-entity/first-image.png#lightbox)

2. Select **Create new intent**. 

    [ ![Screenshot of Intents page with Create new intent button highlighted](./media/luis-quickstart-intents-regex-entity/create-new-intent-button.png) ](./media/luis-quickstart-intents-regex-entity/create-new-intent-button.png#lightbox)

3. Enter `FindForm` in the pop-up dialog box then select **Done**. 

    ![Screenshot of create new intent dialog with Utilities in the search box](./media/luis-quickstart-intents-regex-entity/create-new-intent-ddl.png)

4. Add example utterances to the intent.

    |Example utterances|
    |--|
    |What is the URL for hrf-123456?|
    |Where is hrf-345678?|
    |When was hrf-456098 updated?|
    |Did John Smith update hrf-234639 last week?|
    |How many version of hrf-345123 are there?|
    |Who needs to authorize form hrf-123456?|
    |How many people need to sign off on hrf-345678?|
    |hrf-234123 date?|
    |author of hrf-546234?|
    |title of hrf-456234?|

    [ ![Screenshot of Intent page with new utterances highlighted](./media/luis-quickstart-intents-regex-entity/findform-intent.png) ](./media/luis-quickstart-intents-regex-entity/findform-intent.png#lightbox)

    The application has prebuilt number entity added from the previous tutorial, so each form number is tagged. This may be enough for your client application but the number won't be labeled with the type of number. Creating a new entity with an appropriate name allows the client application to process the entity appropriately when it is returned from LUIS.

## Create a HRF-number regular expression entity 
Create a regular expression entity to tell LUIS what an HRF-number format is in the following steps:

1. Select **Entities** in the left panel.

2. Select **Create new entity** button on the Entities Page. 

    [![Screenshot of Entities page with Create new entity button highlighted](./media/luis-quickstart-intents-regex-entity/create-new-entity-1.png)](./media/luis-quickstart-intents-regex-entity/create-new-entity-1.png#lightbox)

3. In the pop-up dialog, enter the new entity name `HRF-number`, select **RegEx** as the entity type, enter `hrf-[0-9]{6}` as the Regex, and then select **Done**.

    ![Screenshot of pop-up dialog setting new entity properties](./media/luis-quickstart-intents-regex-entity/create-regex-entity.png)

4. Select **Intents**, then **FindForm** intent to see the regular expression labeled in the utterances. 

    [![Screenshot of Label utterance with existing entity and regex pattern](./media/luis-quickstart-intents-regex-entity/labeled-utterances-for-entity.png)](./media/luis-quickstart-intents-regex-entity/labeled-utterances-for-entity.png#lightbox)

    Because the entity is not a machine-learned entity, the label is applied to the utterances and displayed in the LUIS website as soon as it is created.

## Train the LUIS app
A regular expression entity does not require training but the new intent and utterances do require training. 

1. In the top right side of the LUIS website, select the **Train** button.

    ![Image of training button](./media/luis-quickstart-intents-regex-entity/train-button.png)

2. Training is complete when you see the green status bar at the top of the website confirming success.

    ![Image of success notification bar](./media/luis-quickstart-intents-regex-entity/trained.png)

## Publish the app to get the endpoint URL
In order to get a LUIS prediction in a chatbot or other application, you need to publish the app. 

1. In the top right side of the LUIS website, select the **Publish** button. 

    ![Screenshot of FindKnowledgeBase with top navigation Publish button highlighted](./media/luis-quickstart-intents-regex-entity/publish-button.png)

2. Select the Production slot and the **Publish** button.

    ![Screenshot of Publish page with Publish to production slot button highlighted](./media/luis-quickstart-intents-regex-entity/publish-to-production.png)

3. Publishing is complete when you see the green status bar at the top of the website confirming success.

## Query the endpoint with a different utterance
1. On the **Publish** page, select the **endpoint** link at the bottom of the page. This action opens another browser window with the endpoint URL in the address bar. 

    ![Screenshot of Publish page with endpoint URL highlighted](./media/luis-quickstart-intents-regex-entity/publish-select-endpoint.png)

2. Go to the end of the URL in the address and enter `When were HRF-123456 and hrf-234567 published in the last year?`. The last querystring parameter is `q`, the utterance **query**. This utterance is not the same as any of the labeled utterances so it is a good test and should return the `FindForm` intent with the two form numbers of `HRF-123456` and `hrf-234567`.

    ```
    {
      "query": "When were HRF-123456 and hrf-234567 published in the last year?",

          "endIndex": 61,
          "resolution": {
            "values": [
              {
                "timex": "2017",
                "type": "daterange",
                "start": "2017-01-01",
                "end": "2018-01-01"
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        {
          "entity": "hrf-123456",
          "type": "HRF-number",
          "startIndex": 10,
          "endIndex": 19
        },
        {
          "entity": "hrf-234567",
          "type": "HRF-number",
          "startIndex": 25,
          "endIndex": 34
        },
        {
          "entity": "-123456",
          "type": "builtin.number",
          "startIndex": 13,
          "endIndex": 19,
          "resolution": {
            "value": "-123456"
          }
        },
        {
          "entity": "-234567",
          "type": "builtin.number",
          "startIndex": 28,
          "endIndex": 34,
          "resolution": {
            "value": "-234567"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    The numbers in the utterance are returned twice, once as the new entity `hrf-number`, and once as a prebuilt entity, `number`. An utterance can have more than one entity, and more than one of the same type of entity, as this example shows. By using a regular expression entity, LUIS extracts named data, which is more programmatically helpful to the client application receiving the JSON response.

## What has this LUIS app accomplished?
This app identified the intention and returned the extracted data. 

Your chatbot now has enough information to determine the primary action, `FindForm`, and which form numbers were in the search. 

## Where is this LUIS data used? 
LUIS is done with this request. The calling application, such as a chatbot, can take the topScoringIntent result and the form numbers and search a third-party API. LUIS doesn't do that work. LUIS only determines what the user's intention is and extracts data about that intention. 

## Clean up resources
When no longer needed, delete the LUIS app. Select **My apps** from the top left menu. Select the ellipsis (***...***) to the right of the app name in the app list, select **Delete**. On the pop-up dialog **Delete app?**, select **Ok**.
