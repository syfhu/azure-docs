# Quickstart for Bing Spell Check API with Python 
<a name="HOLTop"></a>

This article shows you how to use the [Bing Spell Check API](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/spell-check/) with Python. The Spell Check API returns a list of words it does not recognize along with suggested replacements. Typically, you would submit text to this API and then either make the suggested replacements in the text or show them to the user of your application so they can decide whether to make the replacements. This article shows how to send a request that contains the text "Hollo, wrld!" The suggested replacements are "Hello" and "world."

## Prerequisites

You will need [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run this code.

You must have a [Cognitive Services API account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) with **Bing Spell Check API v7**. The [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/#lang) is sufficient for this quickstart. You need the access key provided when you activate your free trial, or you may use a paid subscription key from your Azure dashboard.

## Get Spell Check results

1. Create a new Python project in your favorite IDE.
2. Add the code provided below.
3. Replace the `subscriptionKey` value with an access key valid for your subscription.
4. Run the program.

```python
import http.client, urllib.parse, json

text = 'Hollo, wrld!'

data = {'text': text}

# NOTE: Replace this example key with a valid subscription key.
key = 'ENTER KEY HERE'

host = 'api.cognitive.microsoft.com'
path = '/bing/v7.0/spellcheck?'
params = 'mkt=en-us&mode=proof'

headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': key,
'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}

# The headers in the following example 
# are optional but should be considered as required:
#
# X-MSEdge-ClientIP: 999.999.999.999  
# X-Search-Location: lat: +90.0000000000000;long: 00.0000000000000;re:100.000000000000
# X-MSEdge-ClientID: <Client ID from Previous Response Goes Here>

conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection(host)
body = urllib.parse.urlencode (data)
conn.request ("POST", path + params, body, headers)
response = conn.getresponse ()
output = json.dumps(json.loads(response.read()), indent=4)
print (output)
```

**Response**

A successful response is returned in JSON, as shown in the following example: 

```json
{
   "_type": "SpellCheck",
   "flaggedTokens": [
      {
         "offset": 0,
         "token": "Hollo",
         "type": "UnknownToken",
         "suggestions": [
            {
               "suggestion": "Hello",
               "score": 0.9115257530801
            },
            {
               "suggestion": "Hollow",
               "score": 0.858039839213461
            },
            {
               "suggestion": "Hallo",
               "score": 0.597385084464481
            }
         ]
      },
      {
         "offset": 7,
         "token": "wrld",
         "type": "UnknownToken",
         "suggestions": [
            {
               "suggestion": "world",
               "score": 0.9115257530801
            }
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```
