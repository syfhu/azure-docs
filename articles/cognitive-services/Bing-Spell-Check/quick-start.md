# Your first spell check request

Before you can make your first call, you need to get a Cognitive Services subscription key. To get a key, see [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=spellcheck-api).

To check a text string for spelling and grammar errors, you'd send a GET request to the following endpoint:  
  
```
https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v5.0/spellcheck
```

> [!NOTE]
> V7 Preview endpoint:
> 
> ```
> https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/spellcheck
> ```  
  
The request must use the HTTPS protocol.

We recommend that all requests originate from a server. Distributing the key as part of a client application provides more opportunity for a malicious third-party to access it. Also, making calls from a server provides a single upgrade point for future versions of the API.

The request must specify the [text](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-spell-check-api-v5-reference#text) query parameter, which contains the text string to proof. Although optional, the request should also specify the [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-spell-check-api-v5-reference#mkt) query parameter, which identifies the market where you want the results to come from. For a list of optional query parameters such as `mode`, see [Query Parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-spell-check-api-v5-reference#query-parameters). All query parameter values must be URL encoded.  
  
The request must specify the [Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-spell-check-api-v5-reference#subscriptionkey) header. Although optional, you are encouraged to also specify the following headers:  
  
-   [User-Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-spell-check-api-v5-reference#useragent)  
-   [X-MSEdge-ClientID](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-spell-check-api-v5-reference#clientid)  
-   [X-Search-ClientIP](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-spell-check-api-v5-reference#clientip)  
-   [X-Search-Location](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-spell-check-api-v5-reference#location)  

For a list of all request and response headers, see [Headers](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-spell-check-api-v5-reference#headers).

## The request

The following shows a request that includes all the suggested query parameters and headers. If it's your first time calling any of the Bing APIs, don't include the client ID header. Only include the client ID if you've previously called a Bing API and Bing returned a client ID for the user and device combination. 
  
```  
GET https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v5.0/spellcheck?text=when+its+your+turn+turn,+john,+come+runing&mkt=en-us HTTP/1.1  
Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: 123456789ABCDE  
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0; Trident/6.0; IEMobile/10.0; ARM; Touch; NOKIA; Lumia 822)  
X-Search-ClientIP: 999.999.999.999  
X-Search-Location: lat:47.60357;long:-122.3295;re:100  
X-MSEdge-ClientID: <blobFromPriorResponseGoesHere>  
Host: api.cognitive.microsoft.com  
```  

> [!NOTE]
> V7 Preview request:
