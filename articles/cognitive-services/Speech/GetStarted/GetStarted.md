# Get started with Speech Service

To use the Microsoft speech recognition service to convert audio to text, see the Speech Recognition [REST APIs](GetStartedREST.md) or the [client libraries](GetStartedClientLibraries.md).

To use the Microsoft text-to-speech service, see the [Text to Speech API reference](../api-reference-rest/bingvoiceoutput.md).
