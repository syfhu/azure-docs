# Quickstart: Generate a thumbnail with Python

In this quickstart, you generate a thumbnail from an image using Computer Vision.

You can run this quickstart in a step-by step fashion using a Jupyter notebook on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org). To launch Binder, select the following button:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/cognitive-services-notebooks/master?filepath=VisionAPI.ipynb)

## Prerequisites

To use Computer Vision, you need a subscription key; see [Obtaining Subscription Keys](../Vision-API-How-to-Topics/HowToSubscribe.md).

## Intelligently generate a thumbnail

With the [Get Thumbnail method](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fb), you can generate a thumbnail of an image. You specify the height and width, which can differ from the aspect ratio of the input image. Computer Vision uses smart cropping to intelligently identify the region of interest and generate cropping coordinates based on that region.

To run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code to a new Python script file.
1. Replace `<Subscription Key>` with your valid subscription key.
1. Change the `vision_base_url` value to the location where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
1. Optionally, change the `image_url` value to another image.
1. Run the script.

The following code uses the Python `requests` library to call the Computer Vision Analyze Image API. The API key is passed in via the `headers` dictionary. The size of the thumbnail is passed in via the `params` dictionary. The thumbnail is returned as a byte array in the response.

## Get Thumbnail request

```python
import requests
# If you are using a Jupyter notebook, uncomment the following line.
#%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# Replace <Subscription Key> with your valid subscription key.
subscription_key = "<Subscription Key>"
assert subscription_key

# You must use the same region in your REST call as you used to get your
# subscription keys. For example, if you got your subscription keys from
# westus, replace "westcentralus" in the URI below with "westus".
#
# Free trial subscription keys are generated in the westcentralus region.
# If you use a free trial subscription key, you shouldn't need to change
# this region.
vision_base_url = "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/"

thumbnail_url = vision_base_url + "generateThumbnail"

# Set image_url to the URL of an image that you want to analyze.
image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Bloodhound_Puppy.jpg"

headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key}
params  = {'width': '50', 'height': '50', 'smartCropping': 'true'}
data    = {'url': image_url}
response = requests.post(thumbnail_url, headers=headers, params=params, json=data)
response.raise_for_status()

thumbnail = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))

# Display the thumbnail.
plt.imshow(thumbnail)
plt.axis("off")

# Verify the thumbnail size.
print("Thumbnail is {0}-by-{1}".format(*thumbnail.size))
```

## Next steps

Explore a Python application that uses Computer Vision to perform optical character recognition (OCR); create smart-cropped thumbnails; plus detect, categorize, tag, and describe visual features, including faces, in an image.
