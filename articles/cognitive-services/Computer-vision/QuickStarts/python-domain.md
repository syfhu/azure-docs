# Quickstart: Use a domain model with Python

In this quickstart, you use domain models to identify celebrities and landmarks in an image using Computer Vision.

You can run this quickstart in a step-by step fashion using a Jupyter notebook on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org). To launch Binder, select the following button:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/cognitive-services-notebooks/master?filepath=VisionAPI.ipynb)

## Prerequisites

To use Computer Vision, you need a subscription key; see [Obtaining Subscription Keys](../Vision-API-How-to-Topics/HowToSubscribe.md).

## Identify celebrities and landmarks

With the [Recognize Domain Specific Content method](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e200), you can identify a specific set of objects in an image. The two domain-specific models that are currently available are _celebrities_ and _landmarks_.

To run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code to a new Python script file.
1. Replace `<Subscription Key>` with your valid subscription key.
1. Change the `vision_base_url` value to the location where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
1. Optionally, change the `image_url` value to another image.
1. Run the script.

The following code uses the Python `requests` library to call the Computer Vision Analyze Image API. It returns the results as a JSON object. The API key is passed in via the `headers` dictionary. The model to use is passed in via the `params` dictionary.

## Landmark identification

### Recognize Landmark request

```python
import requests
# If you are using a Jupyter notebook, uncomment the following line.
#%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# Replace <Subscription Key> with your valid subscription key.
subscription_key = "<Subscription Key>"
assert subscription_key

# You must use the same region in your REST call as you used to get your
# subscription keys. For example, if you got your subscription keys from
# westus, replace "westcentralus" in the URI below with "westus".
#
# Free trial subscription keys are generated in the westcentralus region.
# If you use a free trial subscription key, you shouldn't need to change
# this region.
vision_base_url = "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/"

landmark_analyze_url = vision_base_url + "models/landmarks/analyze"

# Set image_url to the URL of an image that you want to analyze.
image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/" + \
    "Bunker_Hill_Monument_2005.jpg"

headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key}
params  = {'model': 'landmarks'}
data    = {'url': image_url}
response = requests.post(
    landmark_analyze_url, headers=headers, params=params, json=data)
response.raise_for_status()

# The 'analysis' object contains various fields that describe the image. The
# most relevant landmark for the image is obtained from the 'result' property.
analysis = response.json()
assert analysis["result"]["landmarks"] is not []
print(analysis)
landmark_name = analysis["result"]["landmarks"][0]["name"].capitalize()

# Display the image and overlay it with the landmark name.
image = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get(image_url).content))
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis("off")
_ = plt.title(landmark_name, size="x-large", y=-0.1)
```

### Recognize Landmark response

A successful response is returned in JSON, for example:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "landmarks": [
      {
        "name": "Bunker Hill Monument",
        "confidence": 0.9768505096435547
      }
    ]
  },
  "requestId": "659a10cd-44bb-44db-9147-a295b853b2b8",
  "metadata": {
    "height": 1600,
    "width": 1200,
    "format": "Jpeg"
  }
}
```

## Celebrity identification

### Recognize Celebrity request

```python
import requests
# If you are using a Jupyter notebook, uncomment the following line.
#%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# Replace <Subscription Key> with your valid subscription key.
subscription_key = "<Subscription Key>"
assert subscription_key

vision_base_url = "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/"

celebrity_analyze_url = vision_base_url + "models/celebrities/analyze"

# Set image_url to the URL of an image that you want to analyze.
image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/" + \
    "Bill_gates_portrait.jpg"

headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key}
params  = {'model': 'celebrities'}
data    = {'url': image_url}
response = requests.post(
    celebrity_analyze_url, headers=headers, params=params, json=data)
response.raise_for_status()

# The 'analysis' object contains various fields that describe the image. The
# most relevant celebrity for the image is obtained from the 'result' property.
analysis = response.json()
assert analysis["result"]["celebrities"] is not []
print(analysis)
celebrity_name = analysis["result"]["celebrities"][0]["name"].capitalize()

# Display the image and overlay it with the celebrity name.
image = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get(image_url).content))
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis("off")
_ = plt.title(celebrity_name, size="x-large", y=-0.1)
```

### Recognize Celebrity response

A successful response is returned in JSON, for example:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "celebrities": [
      {
        "faceRectangle": {
          "top": 123,
          "left": 156,
          "width": 187,
          "height": 187
        },
        "name": "Bill Gates",
        "confidence": 0.9993845224380493
      }
    ]
  },
  "requestId": "f14ec1d0-62d4-4296-9ceb-6b5776dc2020",
  "metadata": {
    "height": 521,
    "width": 550,
    "format": "Jpeg"
  }
}
```

## Next steps

Explore a Python application that uses Computer Vision to perform optical character recognition (OCR); create smart-cropped thumbnails; plus detect, categorize, tag, and describe visual features, including faces, in an image.
