# Quickstart: Generate a thumbnail with Ruby

In this quickstart, you generate a thumbnail from an image using Computer Vision.

## Prerequisites

To use Computer Vision, you need a subscription key; see [Obtaining Subscription Keys](../Vision-API-How-to-Topics/HowToSubscribe.md).

## Get Thumbnail request

With the [Get Thumbnail method](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fb), you can generate a thumbnail of an image. You specify the height and width, which can differ from the aspect ratio of the input image. Computer Vision uses smart cropping to intelligently identify the region of interest and generate cropping coordinates based on that region.

To run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code into an editor.
1. Replace `<Subscription Key>` with your valid subscription key.
1. Change the `uri` value to the location where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
1. Optionally, change the image (`{\"url\":\"...`) to analyze.
1. Save the file with an `.rb` extension.
1. Open the Ruby Command Prompt and run the file, for example: `ruby myfile.rb`.

```ruby
require 'net/http'

# You must use the same location in your REST call as you used to get your
# subscription keys. For example, if you got your subscription keys from westus,
# replace "westcentralus" in the URL below with "westus".
uri = URI('https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/generateThumbnail')
uri.query = URI.encode_www_form({
    # Request parameters
    'width' => '100',
    'height' => '100',
    'smartCropping' => 'true'
})

request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri.request_uri)

# Request headers
# Replace <Subscription Key> with your valid subscription key.
request['Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key'] = '<Subscription Key>'
request['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'

request.body =
    "{\"url\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/" +
    "Shorkie_Poo_Puppy.jpg/1280px-Shorkie_Poo_Puppy.jpg\"}"

response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port, :use_ssl => uri.scheme == 'https') do |http|
    http.request(request)
end

#puts response.body
```

## Get Thumbnail response

A successful response contains the thumbnail image binary. If the request fails, the response contains an error code and a message to help determine what went wrong.

## Next steps
