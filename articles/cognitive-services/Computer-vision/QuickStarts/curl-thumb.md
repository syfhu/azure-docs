# Quickstart: Generate a thumbnail with cURL

In this quickstart, you generate a thumbnail from an image using Computer Vision.

## Prerequisites

To use Computer Vision, you need a subscription key; see [Obtaining Subscription Keys](../Vision-API-How-to-Topics/HowToSubscribe.md).

## Get Thumbnail request

With the [Get Thumbnail method](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fb), you can generate a thumbnail of an image. You specify the height and width, which can differ from the aspect ratio of the input image. Computer Vision uses smart cropping to intelligently identify the region of interest and generate cropping coordinates based on that region.

To run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code into an editor.
1. Replace `<Subscription Key>` with your valid subscription key.
1. Replace `<File>` with the path and filename to save the thumbnail.
1. Change the Request URL (`https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0`) to use the location where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
1. Optionally, change the image (`{\"url\":\"...`) to analyze.
1. Open a command window on a computer with cURL installed.
1. Paste the code in the window and run the command.

>[!NOTE]
>You must use the same location in your REST call as you used to obtain your subscription keys. For example, if you obtained your subscription keys from westus, replace "westcentralus" in the URL below with "westus".

```json
curl -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <Subscription Key>" -o <File> -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/generateThumbnail?width=100&height=100&smartCropping=true" -d "{\"url\":\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Shorkie_Poo_Puppy.jpg/1280px-Shorkie_Poo_Puppy.jpg\"}"
```

## Get Thumbnail response

A successful response writes the thumbnail image to `<File>`. If the request fails, the response contains an error code and a message to help determine what went wrong.

## Next steps

Explore the Computer Vision APIs used to analyze an image, detect celebrities and landmarks, create a thumbnail, and extract printed and handwritten text.
