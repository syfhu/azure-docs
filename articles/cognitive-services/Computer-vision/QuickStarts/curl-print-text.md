# Quickstart: Extract printed text (OCR) with cURL

In this quickstart, you extract printed text, also known as optical character recognition (OCR), from an image using Computer Vision.

## Prerequisites

To use Computer Vision, you need a subscription key; see [Obtaining Subscription Keys](../Vision-API-How-to-Topics/HowToSubscribe.md).

## OCR request

With the [OCR method](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc), you can detect printed text in an image and extract recognized characters into a machine-usable character stream.

To run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code into an editor.
1. Replace `<Subscription Key>` with your valid subscription key.
1. Change the Request URL (`https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0`) to use the location where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
1. Optionally, change the image (`{\"url\":\"...`) to analyze.
1. Open a command window on a computer with cURL installed.
1. Paste the code in the window and run the command.

>[!NOTE]
>You must use the same location in your REST call as you used to obtain your subscription keys. For example, if you obtained your subscription keys from westus, replace "westcentralus" in the URL below with "westus".

```json
curl -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <Subscription Key>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/ocr?language=unk&detectOrientation=true" -d "{\"url\":\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png/338px-Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png\"}"
```

## OCR response

Upon success, the OCR results returned include text, bounding box for regions, lines, and words, for example:

```json
