# Quickstart: Analyze a remote image with cURL

In this quickstart, you analyze a remote image to extract visual features using Computer Vision. To analyze a local image, see [Analyze a local image with cURL](curl-disk.md).

## Prerequisites

To use Computer Vision, you need a subscription key; see [Obtaining Subscription Keys](../Vision-API-How-to-Topics/HowToSubscribe.md).

## Analyze a remote image

With the [Analyze Image method](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa), you can extract visual features based on image content. You can upload an image or specify an image URL and choose which features to return, including:

* A detailed list of tags related to the image content.
* A description of image content in a complete sentence.
* The coordinates, gender, and age of any faces contained in the image.
* The ImageType (clip art or a line drawing).
* The dominant color, the accent color, or whether an image is black & white.
* The category defined in this [taxonomy](../Category-Taxonomy.md).
* Does the image contain adult or sexually suggestive content?

To run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code into an editor.
1. Replace `<Subscription Key>` with your valid subscription key.
1. Change the Request URL (`https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0`) to use the location where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
1. Optionally, change the image (`{\"url\":\"...`) to analyze.
1. Optionally, change the response language (`language=en`).
1. Open a command window on a computer with cURL installed.
1. Paste the code in the window and run the command.

>[!NOTE]
>You must use the same location in your REST call as you used to obtain your subscription keys. For example, if you obtained your subscription keys from westus, replace "westcentralus" in the URL below with "westus".

## Analyze Image request

```json
curl -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <Subscription Key>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/analyze?visualFeatures=Categories,Description&details=Landmarks&language=en" -d "{\"url\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Shaki_waterfall.jpg\"}"
```

## Analyze Image response

A successful response is returned in JSON, for example:

```json

      "score": 0.9921875,
