# Quickstart: Extract printed text (OCR) with Ruby

In this quickstart, you extract printed text, also known as optical character recognition (OCR), from an image using Computer Vision.

## Prerequisites

To use Computer Vision, you need a subscription key; see [Obtaining Subscription Keys](../Vision-API-How-to-Topics/HowToSubscribe.md).

## OCR request

With the [OCR method](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc), you can detect printed text in an image and extract recognized characters into a machine-usable character stream.

To run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code into an editor.
1. Replace `<Subscription Key>` with your valid subscription key.
1. Change the `uri` value to the location where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
1. Optionally, change the image (`{\"url\":\"...`) to analyze.
1. Save the file with an `.rb` extension.
1. Open the Ruby Command Prompt and run the file, for example: `ruby myfile.rb`.

```ruby
require 'net/http'

# You must use the same location in your REST call as you used to get your
# subscription keys. For example, if you got your subscription keys from westus,
# replace "westcentralus" in the URL below with "westus".
uri = URI('https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/ocr')
uri.query = URI.encode_www_form({
    # Request parameters
    'language' => 'unk',
    'detectOrientation' => 'true'
})

request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri.request_uri)

# Request headers
# Replace <Subscription Key> with your valid subscription key.
request['Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key'] = '<Subscription Key>'
request['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'

request.body =
    "{\"url\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/" +
    "Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png/338px-Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png\"}"

response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port, :use_ssl => uri.scheme == 'https') do |http|
    http.request(request)
end

puts response.body
```

## OCR response

Upon success, the OCR results returned include text, bounding box for regions, lines, and words, for example:

```json

              "text": "WISH"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
