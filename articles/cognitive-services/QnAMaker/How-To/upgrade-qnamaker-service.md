# Upgrade your QnA Maker service
You can choose to upgrade individual components of the QnA Maker stack after the initial creation. See the details of the dependent components and SKU selection [here](https://aka.ms/qnamaker-docs-capacity).

## Upgrade QnA Maker Management SKU
To upgrade the QnA Maker management SKU:
1. Go to your QnA Maker resource in the Azure portal, and select **Pricing tier**.

## Upgrade App service
You can [scale up](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/web-sites-scale) or scale down the App service.

1. Go to the App service resource in the Azure portal, and select **scale up** or **scale down** options as required.

## Upgrade Azure Search service
Currently it is not possible to perform an in place upgrade of the Azure search SKU. However, you can create a new Azure search resource with the desired SKU, restore the data to the new resource, and then link it to the QnA Maker stack.

1. Create a new Azure search resource in the Azure portal, and choose the desired SKU.

2. Restore the indexes from your original Azure search resource to the new one. See the backup restore sample code [here](https://github.com/pchoudhari/QnAMakerBackupRestore).

3. Once the data is restored, go to your new Azure search resource, select **Keys**, and note down the **Name** and the **Admin key**.
