# Create a knowledge base

QnA Maker makes it very simple to onboard your existing data sources to create a knowledge base. You can create a new QnA Maker knowledge base from FAQ pages, products manuals, structured documents or add them editorially.

## Steps

1. To get started, sign into to the [QnA Maker portal](https://qnamaker.ai) with your azure credentials and click on **Create new service**.

2. If you have not already created a QnA Maker service, select **Create a QnA service**. Otherwise, choose a QnA Maker service from the drop-downs in Step 2. Select the QnA Maker service that will host the Knowledge Base.

3. Enter the following information in order to create the knowledge base.

    ![Set data sources](../media/qnamaker-how-to-create-kb/set-data-sources.png)

    - Give your service a **name.** Duplicate names are supported and special characters are supported as well.
    - Paste in URLs which will be extracted from. See more information on the types of sources supported [here](../Concepts/data-sources-supported.md).
    - Alternately, upload files from which data is extracted. See the [pricing information](https://aka.ms/qnamaker-pricing
) to see how many documents you can add.
    - If you want to manually add QnAs, you can skip linking files.

4. Select **Create**.

5. It takes a few minutes for data to be extracted.
