# Create a new knowledge base in Python

This quickstart walks you through creating a sample QnA Maker knowledge base, programmatically, that will appear in your Azure Dashboard of your Cognitive Services API account.

Two sample FAQ URLs are given below (in the **req** dictionary item 'urls'). QnA Maker automatically extracts questions and answers from semi-structured content, like FAQs, as explained more in this [data sources](../Concepts/data-sources-supported.md) document. You may also use your own FAQ URLs in this quickstart.

## Prerequisites

You'll need [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run this code.

You must have a [Cognitive Services API account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) with **QnA Maker** chosen as your resource. You'll need a paid subscription key from your [Azure dashboard](https://ms.portal.azure.com/). To retrieve your key, select **Keys** under **Resource Management** in your dashboard. Either key will work for this quickstart.

## Create knowledge base

The following code creates a new knowledge base, using the [Create](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5a93fcf85b4ccd136866eb37/operations/5ac266295b4ccd1554da75ff) method.

1. Create a new Python project in your favorite IDE.
2. Add the code provided below.
3. Replace the `subscriptionKey` value with your valid subscription key.
4. Run the program.

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import http.client, urllib.parse, json, time

# **********************************************
# *** Update or verify the following values. ***
# **********************************************

# Replace this with a valid subscription key.
subscriptionKey = 'YOUR SUBSCRIPTION KEY HERE'

# Represents the various elements used to create HTTP request path
# for QnA Maker operations.
host = 'westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com'
service = '/qnamaker/v4.0'
method = '/knowledgebases/create'

'''
Formats and indents JSON for display.
:param content: The JSON to format and indent.
:type: string
:return: A string containing formatted and indented JSON.
:rtype: string
'''
def pretty_print(content):
  # Note: We convert content to and from an object so we can pretty-print it.
  return json.dumps(json.loads(content), indent=4)

'''
Sends the POST request to create the knowledge base.
:param path: The URL path being called.
:type: string
:param content: The contents of your POST.
:type: string
:return: A header that creates the knowledge base, the JSON response
:rtype: string, string
'''
def create_kb(path, content):
  print('Calling ' + host + path + '.')
  headers = {
    'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscriptionKey,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Content-Length': len (content)
  }
  conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection(host)
  conn.request ("POST", path, content, headers)
  response = conn.getresponse ()
  # /knowledgebases/create returns an HTTP header named Location that contains a URL
  # to check the status of the operation in creating the knowledge base.
  return response.getheader('Location'), response.read ()

'''
Checks the status of the request to create the knowledge base.
:param path: The URL path being checked
:type: string
:return: The header Retry-After if request is not finished, the JSON response
:rtype: string, string
'''
def check_status(path):
  print('Calling ' + host + path + '.')
  headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscriptionKey}
  conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection(host)
  conn.request("GET", path, None, headers)
  response = conn.getresponse ()
  # If the operation is not finished, /operations returns an HTTP header named Retry-After
  # that contains the number of seconds to wait before we query the operation again.
  return response.getheader('Retry-After'), response.read ()

'''
Dictionary that holds the knowledge base.
The data source includes a QnA pair with metadata, the URL for the
QnA Maker FAQ article, and the URL for the Azure Bot Service FAQ article.

## Understand what QnA Maker returns

A successful response is returned in JSON, as shown in the following example. Your results may differ slightly. If the final call returns a "Succeeded" state, your knowledge base was created successfully. To troubleshoot refer to the [Get Operation Details](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5a93fcf85b4ccd136866eb37/operations/operations_getoperationdetails) of the QnA Maker API.

Once your knowledge base is created, you can view it in your QnA Maker Portal, [My knowledge bases](https://www.qnamaker.ai/Home/MyServices) page. Select your knowledge base name, for example QnA Maker FAQ, to view.
