# Call and response: your first Bing Web Search query for Node.js

The Bing Web Search API provides a experience similar to Bing.com/Search by returning search results that Bing determines are relevant to the user's query. The results may include Web pages, images, videos, news, and entities, along with related search queries, spelling corrections, time zones, unit conversion, translations, and calculations. The kinds of results you get are based on their relevance and the tier of the Bing Search APIs to which you subscribe.

This article includes a simple console application that performs a Bing Web Search API query and displays the returned raw search results, which are in JSON format. While this application is written in JavaScript and runs under Node.js, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with any programming language that can make HTTP requests and parse JSON. 

## Prerequisites

You need [Node.js 6](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to run this code.

You must have a [Cognitive Services API account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) with **Bing Search APIs**. The [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=bing-web-search-api) is sufficient for this quickstart. You need the access key provided when you activate your free trial, or you may use a paid subscription key from your Azure dashboard.

## Running the application

To run this application, follow these steps.

1. Create a new Node.js project in your favorite IDE or editor.
2. Add the provided code.
3. Replace the `subscriptionKey` value with an access key valid for your subscription.
4. Run the program.

```javascript
'use strict';

let https = require('https');

// **********************************************
// *** Update or verify the following values. ***
// **********************************************

// Replace the subscriptionKey string value with your valid subscription key.
let subscriptionKey = 'enter key here';

// Verify the endpoint URI.  At this writing, only one endpoint is used for Bing
// search APIs.  In the future, regional endpoints may be available.  If you
// encounter unexpected authorization errors, double-check this host against
// the endpoint for your Bing Web search instance in your Azure dashboard.
let host = 'api.cognitive.microsoft.com';
let path = '/bing/v7.0/search';

let term = 'Microsoft Cognitive Services';

let response_handler = function (response) {
    let body = '';
    response.on('data', function (d) {
        body += d;
    });
    response.on('end', function () {
        console.log('\nRelevant Headers:\n');
        for (var header in response.headers)
            // header keys are lower-cased by Node.js
            if (header.startsWith("bingapis-") || header.startsWith("x-msedge-"))
                 console.log(header + ": " + response.headers[header]);
        body = JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(body), null, '  ');
        console.log('\nJSON Response:\n');
        console.log(body);
    });
    response.on('error', function (e) {
        console.log('Error: ' + e.message);
    });
};

let bing_web_search = function (search) {
  console.log('Searching the Web for: ' + term);
  let request_params = {
		method : 'GET',
		hostname : host,
		path : path + '?q=' + encodeURIComponent(search),
		headers : {
			'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key' : subscriptionKey,
		}
	};

	let req = https.request(request_params, response_handler);
	req.end();
}

if (subscriptionKey.length === 32) {
    bing_web_search(term);
} else {
    console.log('Invalid Bing Search API subscription key!');
    console.log('Please paste yours into the source code.');
}

```

## JSON response

A sample response follows. To limit the length of the JSON, only a single result is shown, and other parts of the response have been truncated.
