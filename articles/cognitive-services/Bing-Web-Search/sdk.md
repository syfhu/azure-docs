# Bing Search SDK
The Bing Web Search API samples include scenarios that:
1. Use a single-word query to get results and print out name and URL for the first of each web, image, news, and video results.
2. Query on a phrase, verify the number of results, and print out name and URL of first result.
3. Query on search term with response filters set to `news` and print the details of news results.
4. Query on a search term with `answerCount` and `promote` parameters, then print details of results.
