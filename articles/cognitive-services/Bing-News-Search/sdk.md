# Bing Search SDK
The Bing News Search API samples include scenarios that:
1. Query news for search terms with `market` and `count` parameters, verify number of results, and print out `totalEstimatedMatches`, name, URL, description, published time, and name of provider of the first news result.
2. Query most recent news for search terms with `freshness` and `sortBy` parameters, verify number of results, and print out `totalEstimatedMatches`, URL, description, published time and name of provider of the first news result.
3. Query category news for `movie` and `TV entertainment` with safe search, verify number of results, and print out category, name, URL, description, published time and name of provider of the first news result.
4. Query news trending topics in Bing, verify number of results and print out name, text of query, `webSearchUrl`, `newsSearchUrl` and image URL of the first news result.
