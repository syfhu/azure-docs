# Translate speech using Speech service

The [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md) is the simplest way to use speech translation in your application. The SDK provides the full functionality of the service. The basic process for performing speech translation includes the following steps:

1. Create a speech factory and provide a Speech service subscription key or an authorization token. You also configure the source and target translation languages at this point, as well as specifying whether you want text or speech output.

2. Get a recognizer from the factory. For translation, select a translation recognizer. (The other recognizers are for *Speech to Text*.) There are various flavors of translation recognizer based on the audio source you are using.

4. Tie up events for asynchronous operation, if desired. The recognizer calls your event handlers when it has interim and final results. Otherwise, your application receives a final translation result.

5. Start recognition and translation.
