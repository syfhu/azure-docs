### Customization

Custom **Text to Speech** voice fonts support US English (en-US) and Chinese (zh-CN).

## Speech Translation

The **Speech Translation** API supports different languages for speech-to-speech and speech-to-text translation. The source language must always be from the Speech Language table below. The available target languages depend on whether the translation target is speech or text.

You can obtain the list of languages either programmatically or using the REST API's Languages endpoint. The list provides each language code, as well as the language name in Englishâ€”or in any other supported language. This list is updated by the Microsoft Translator service whenever a new language becomes available.
