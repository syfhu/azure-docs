# Speech SDK reference

The Speech Software Development Kit (SDK) provides your applications access to the functions of the Speech service, making it easier to develop speech-enabled software. Currently, the SDKs provide access to **Speech to Text** and **Speech Translation**. Text to Speech employs [REST] (https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/rest-apis) POST calls over HTTP.

The table below describes the currently supported programming languages and operating systems.

|Programming language|Platform|API Reference|
|-|-|-|
|C#|Windows|[Browse](https://aka.ms/csspeech/csharpref)
|C/C++|Windows, Linux|[Browse](https://aka.ms/csspeech/cppref)
|Java\*|Devices|[Browse](https://aka.ms/csspeech/javaref)

\* *The Java SDK is part of the [Speech Devices SDK](speech-devices-sdk.md).*
