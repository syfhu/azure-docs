# Sample for intent recognition

> [!NOTE]
> For instructions to download this sample and others, see [Samples for Speech SDK](samples.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Please obtain a subscription key first. In contrast to other services supported by the Cognitive Service Speech SDK, the Intent Recognition services requires a specific subscription key. [Here](https://www.luis.ai) you can find additional information about the intent recognition technology, as well as information about how to acquire a subscription key. Replace your own subscription key, the [region of your subscription](regions.md), and the AppId of your intent model in the appropriate places in the samples.

## Intent recognition using microphone

The code snippet below shows how to recognize intent from microphone input in the default language (`en-US`).

## Intent recognition from a file

The following code snippet recognizes intent from an audio file in the default language (`en-US`), the supported format is single-channel (mono) WAV / PCM with a sampling rate of 16 KHz.
