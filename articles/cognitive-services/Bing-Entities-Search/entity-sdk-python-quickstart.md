# Entity Search SDK Python quickstart

The Entity Search SDK contains the functionality of the REST API for web queries and parsing results.

The [source code for Python Bing Entity Search SDK samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-python-sdk-samples/blob/master/samples/search/entity_search_samples.py) is available on Git Hub.

## Application dependencies
If you don't already have it, install Python. The SDK is compatible with Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6.

The general recommendation for Python development is to use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). 
Install and initialize the virtual environment with the [venv module](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv). You must install virtualenv for Python 2.7.
```
python -m venv mytestenv
```
Install Bing Entity Search SDK dependencies:
```
cd mytestenv
python -m pip install azure-cognitiveservices-search-entitysearch
```
## Entity Search client
Get a [Cognitive Services access key](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/) under *Search*. 
Add imports:
```
from azure.cognitiveservices.search.entitysearch import EntitySearchAPI
from azure.cognitiveservices.search.entitysearch.models import Place, ErrorResponseException
from msrest.authentication import CognitiveServicesCredentials

subscription_key = "YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY"
```
Create an instance of the `CognitiveServicesCredentials`. Instantiate the client:
```
client = EntitySearchAPI(CognitiveServicesCredentials(subscription_key))
```
Search for a single entity (Gibralter) and print out a short description:
```
entity_data = client.entities.search(query="Gibralter")

if entity_data.entities.value:
    # find the entity that represents the dominant one

    main_entities = [entity for entity in entity_data.entities.value
                     if entity.entity_presentation_info.entity_scenario == "DominantEntity"]

    if main_entities:
        print('Searched for "Gibralter" and found a dominant entity with this description:')
        print(main_entities[0].description)
    else:
        print("Couldn't find main entity Gibralter!")

else:
    print("Didn't see any data..")

```
Search and handle disambiguation results for an ambiguous query (William Gates).
```
def handling_disambiguation(subscription_key):

    client = EntitySearchAPI(CognitiveServicesCredentials(subscription_key))

    try:
        entity_data = client.entities.search(query="william gates")

        if entity_data.entities.value:
            # find the entity that represents the dominant one

            main_entities = [entity for entity in entity_data.entities.value
                             if entity.entity_presentation_info.entity_scenario == "DominantEntity"]

            disambig_entities = [entity for entity in entity_data.entities.value
                                 if entity.entity_presentation_info.entity_scenario == "DisambiguationItem"]

            if main_entities:
                main_entity = main_entities[0]
                type_hint = main_entity.entity_presentation_info.entity_type_display_hint
                
                print('Searched for "William Gates" and found a dominant entity {}with this description:'.format(
                    '"with type hint "{}" '.format(type_hint) if type_hint else ''))
                print(main_entity.description)
            else:
                print("Couldn't find a reliable dominant entity for William Gates!")
        
            if disambig_entities:
                print("\nThis query is pretty ambiguous and can be referring to multiple things. Did you mean one of these:")
                suggestions = []
                for disambig_entity in disambig_entities:
                    suggestions.append("{} the {}".format(disambig_entity.name, disambig_entity.entity_presentation_info.entity_type_display_hint))
                print(", or ".join(suggestions))
            else:
                print("We didn't find any disambiguation items for William Gates, so we must be certain what you're talking about!")

        else:
            print("Didn't see any data..")

    except Exception as err:
        print("Encountered exception. {}".format(err))

Search for a single store (Microsoft Store) and print out its phone number.
```
def store_lookup(subscription_key):

            store = entity_data.places.value[0]

            # Some local entities will be places, others won't be. Depending on what class contains the data you want, you can check 
            # using isinstance one of the class, or try to get the attribute and handle the exception (EAFP principle).
            # The recommended Python way is usually EAFP (see https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html)
            # In this case, the item being returned is technically a store, but the Place schema has the data we want (telephone)

            # Pythonic approach : EAFP "Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission"
            try:
