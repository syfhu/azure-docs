# Entity Search endpoint
The **Entity Search API**  includes one endpoint that returns entities from the Web based on a query.

## Endpoint
To get entity results using the **Bing API**, send a `GET` request to the following endpoint. Use the headers and URL parameters to define further specifications.

**Endpoint:** Returns entities that are relevant to the user's search query defined by `?q=""`.
```
 GET https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/entities
```

For details about headers, parameters, market codes, response objects, errors, etc., see the [Bing Entity Search API v7](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-entities-api-v7-reference) reference.

## Response JSON
The response to a entity search request includes results as JSON objects. For examples of the results, see [Get started](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-entities-search/quick-start).

## Next steps
The **Bing** APIs support search actions that return results according to their type. All search endpoints return results as JSON response objects.  All endpoints support queries that return a specific language and/or location by longitude, latitude, and search radius.

For complete information about the parameters supported by each endpoint, see the reference pages for each type.
