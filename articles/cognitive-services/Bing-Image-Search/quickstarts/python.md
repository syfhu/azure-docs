# Call and response: your first Bing Image Search query in Python

The Bing Image Search API provides an experience similar to Bing.com/Images by letting you send a user search query to Bing and get back a list of relevant images.

This walkthrough demonstrates a simple example of calling into the Bing Image Search API and post-processing the resulting JSON object. For more information, see [Bing Image Search documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference).

You can run this example as a Jupyter notebook on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org) by clicking on the launch Binder badge:

## Prerequisites

You must have a [Cognitive Services API account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) with **Bing Search APIs**. The [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=bing-web-search-api) is sufficient for this quickstart. You need the access key provided when you activate your free trial, or you may use a paid subscription key from your Azure dashboard.

## Running the walkthrough
To continue with the walkthrough, set `subscription_key` to your API key for the Bing API service.


```python
subscription_key = None
assert subscription_key
```

Next, verify that the `search_url` endpoint is correct. At this writing, only one endpoint is used for Bing search APIs. If you encounter authorization errors, double-check this value against the Bing search endpoint in your Azure dashboard.


```python
search_url = "https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/images/search"
```

Set `search_term` to look for images of puppies.


```python
search_term = "puppies"
```

The following block uses the `requests` library in Python to call out to the Bing search APIs and return the results as a JSON object. Observe that we pass in the API key via the `headers` dictionary and the search term via the `params` dictionary. To see the full list of options that can be used to filter search results, refer to the [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference) documentation.


```python
import requests

headers = {"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key" : subscription_key}
params  = {"q": search_term, "license": "public", "imageType": "photo"}
response = requests.get(search_url, headers=headers, params=params)
response.raise_for_status()
search_results = response.json()
```

The `search_results` object contains the actual images along with rich metadata such as related items. For example, the following line of code can extract the thumbnail URLS for the first 16 results.


```python
thumbnail_urls = [img["thumbnailUrl"] for img in search_results["value"][:16]]
```

Then, we can use the `PIL` library to download the thumbnail images and the `matplotlib` library to render them on a $4 \times 4$ grid.


```python
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

f, axes = plt.subplots(4, 4)
for i in range(4):
    for j in range(4):
        image_data = requests.get(thumbnail_urls[i+4*j])
        image_data.raise_for_status()
        image = Image.open(BytesIO(image_data.content))        
        axes[i][j].imshow(image)
        axes[i][j].axis("off")
```
