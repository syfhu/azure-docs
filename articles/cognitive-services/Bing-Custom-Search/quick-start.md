# Create your first Bing Custom Search instance
To use Bing Custom Search, you need to create a custom search instance that defines your view or slice of the web. The instance contains settings that specify the public domains, websites, and webpages that you want Bing to search, and any ranking adjustments. To create the instance, use the Bing Custom Search [portal](https://customsearch.ai). 

## Create a custom search instance

To create a Bing Custom Search instance:

1.  Get a key for Custom Search API. See [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=bing-custom-search).
2.	Sign in to the portal using a Microsoft account (MSA). Click the **Sign in** button. If it's your first time using the portal follow the additional steps below, otherwise continue to step 3.
    - If you don’t have an MSA, click **Create a Microsoft account**. The portal asks for permissions to access your data. Click **Yes**.
    - Agree to the Cognitive Services Terms. Check **I agree** and click **Agree**.  
3.	After signing in, click **New Instance** and name the instance. Use a name that’s meaningful and describes the type of content the search returns. You can change the name at any time. 
4.  On the **Active** tab in **Search Experience**, enter the URL of one or more sites you want to include in your search.
5.	To confirm that your instance returns results, enter a query in the preview pane on the right. If there are no results, specify a new site. Bing returns results only for public sites that it has indexed.
6.  Click **Publish** to publish configuration changes to production. When prompted, click **Publish** to confirm.
7.  Click **Production** > **Endpoints** and copy the **Custom Configuration ID**. You need this ID to call the Custom Search API.
