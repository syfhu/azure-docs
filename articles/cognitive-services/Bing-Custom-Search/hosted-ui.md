# Configure your hosted UI experience
After configuring your custom search instance, you can call the Custom Search API to get the search results and display them in your app. Or, if your app is a web app, you can use the hosted UI that Custom Search provides.   

## Configure custom hosted UI
Use the following instructions to configure a hosted UI to include in your web app.
1.	Sign in to Custom Search [portal](https://customsearch.ai).
2.	Click a Custom Search instance. To create an instance, see [Create your first Bing Custom Search instance](quick-start.md).
3.	Click the **Hosted UI** tab.
4.	Select a layout.
    - Search bar and results (default) &mdash; Display a search box and search results
    - Results only &mdash; Don't display a search box, show only results
    - Pop-over &mdash; Don't display a search box, show only results in a sliding overlay
    
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Be sure to include the customConfig query parameter when selecting the **Results only** layout, see [Query parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-custom-search-api-v7-reference#query-parameters).

5.	Under **Additional Configurations**, provide values as appropriate for your app. These settings are optional. To see the effect of applying or removing them, see the preview pane on the right.  Available configuration options are:
    - Web search configurations:
        - Web results enabled &mdash; Determines if web search results are returned
        - Enable autosuggest &mdash; Determines if custom autosuggest is enabled
        - Web results per page &mdash; Number of web search results to display at a time
        - Image caption &mdash; Determines if images are displayed with search results
        - Highlight words &mdash; Determines if results are displayed with search terms in bold
    - Image search configurations:
        - Image results enabled &mdash; Determines if image search results are returned
    - Miscellaneous configurations:
        - Page title &mdash;  Text displayed in the page title area
        - Toolbar theme &mdash; Determines the background color of the page title area
        - Search box text placeholder &mdash; Text displayed in the search box prior to input
        - Title link url &mdash;  Target for the title link
        - Logo url &mdash; Image displayed next to the title 
        - Favicon url &mdash; Icon displayed in the browser title bar

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > At least one of Image search or Web search must be enabled.

6.  Enter the search subscription key, or choose one from the drop-down. The drop-down is populated with keys from your account's Azure subscriptions. See [Cognitive Services API account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account).
7.  If you enabled autosuggest, enter the autosuggest subscription key, or choose one from the drop-down. The drop-down is populated with keys from your account's Azure subscriptions. Custom Autosuggest requires a specifiec subscription tier, see the [pricing pages](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/bing-custom-search/).

> [!NOTE]
> As you make changes to the custom hosted UI configuration, the pane on the right provides a visual reference for the changes made. The displayed search results are not actual results for your instance
