# Making your first Autosuggest query

Before you can make your first call, you need to get a Cognitive Services subscription key. To get a key, see [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=autosuggest-api).

To get Web search results, you'd send a GET request to the following endpoint:

```http
https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v5.0/Suggestions
```

> [!NOTE]
> V7 Preview endpoint:
>
> ```http
> https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/Suggestions
> ```

The request must use the HTTPS protocol.

We recommend that all requests originate from a server. Distributing the key as part of a client application provides more opportunity for a malicious third-party to access it. Also, making calls from a server provides a single upgrade point for future versions of the API.

The request must specify the [q](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-autosuggest-api-v5-reference#query) query parameter, which contains the user's partial search term. Although it's optional, the request should also specify the [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-autosuggest-api-v5-reference#mkt) query parameter, which identifies the market where you want the results to come from. For a list of optional query parameters, see [Query Parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-autosuggest-api-v5-reference#query-parameters). All query parameter values must be URL encoded.

The request must specify the [Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-autosuggest-api-v5-reference#subscriptionkey) header. Although optional, you are encouraged to also specify the following headers:

- [User-Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-autosuggest-api-v5-reference#useragent)
- [X-MSEdge-ClientID](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-autosuggest-api-v5-reference#clientid)
- [X-Search-ClientIP](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-autosuggest-api-v5-reference#clientip)
- [X-Search-Location](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-autosuggest-api-v5-reference#location)

The client IP and location headers are important for returning location aware content.

For a list of all request and response headers, see [Headers](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-autosuggest-api-v5-reference#headers).

## The request

The request should include all the suggested query parameters and headers. You'd call this API each time the user types a new character in the search box. The completeness of the query string impacts the relevance of the suggested query terms that the API returns. The more complete the query string, the more relevant that the list of suggested query terms are. For example, the suggestions that the API may return for *s* are likely to be less relevant than the queries it returns for *sailing dinghies*. 

The following example shows a request that returns the suggested query strings for *sail*.

```http
GET https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v5.0/suggestions?q=sail&mkt=en-us HTTP/1.1  
Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: 123456789ABCDE  
X-MSEdge-ClientIP: 999.999.999.999  
X-Search-Location: lat:47.60357;long:-122.3295;re:100  
X-MSEdge-ClientID: <blobFromPriorResponseGoesHere>  
Host: api.cognitive.microsoft.com  
```

> [!NOTE]
> V7 Preview request:

> ```http
> GET https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/suggestions?q=sail&mkt=en-us HTTP/1.1
> Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: 123456789ABCDE
> X-MSEdge-ClientIP: 999.999.999.999
> X-Search-Location: lat:47.60357;long:-122.3295;re:100
> X-MSEdge-ClientID: <blobFromPriorResponseGoesHere>
> Host: api.cognitive.microsoft.com
> ```

If it's your first time calling any of the Bing APIs, don't include the client ID header. Only include the client ID header if you've previously called a Bing API and Bing returned a client ID for the user and device combination.

The following shows the response to the preceding request. The response includes a web suggestion group that contains a list of search query suggestions. Each suggestion includes a `displayText`, `query`, and `url` field.

The `displayText` field contains the suggested query that you'd use to populate your search box's drop-down list. You must display all suggestions that the response includes, and in the given order.  

If the user selects a query from the drop-down list, you may use the query string in the `query` field to call the [Bing Search API](../bing-web-search/search-the-web.md) and display the results yourself. Or, you could use the URL in the `url` field to send the user to the Bing search results page.
