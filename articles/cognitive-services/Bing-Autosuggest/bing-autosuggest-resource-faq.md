# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about Autosuggest API (Cognitive Services)
 
 Find answers to commonly asked questions about concepts, code, and scenarios related to the Autosuggest API for Azure Cognitive Services.

### How do I get the optional client headers when calling the Bing Autosuggest API from JavaScript?

The following headers are optional, but we recommend that you treat them as required. These headers help the Bing Autosuggest API return more accurate results.

- X-Search-Location
- X-MSEdge-ClientID
- X-MSEdge-ClientIP

However, when you call the Bing Autosuggest API from JavaScript, your browser's built-in security features might prevent you from accessing the values of these headers.

To resolve this, you can make the Bing Autosuggest API request through a CORS proxy. The response from such a proxy has a `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header that whitelists response headers and makes them available to JavaScript.

It's easy to install a CORS proxy to allow our [tutorial app](tutorials/autosuggest.md) to access the optional client headers. First, if you don't already have it, [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then enter the following command at a command prompt.

    npm install -g cors-proxy-server

Next, change the Bing Autosuggest API endpoint in the HTML file to:

    http://localhost:9090/https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/Suggestions

Finally, start the CORS proxy with the following command:

    cors-proxy-server

Leave the command window open while you use the tutorial app; closing the window stops the proxy. In the expandable HTTP Headers section below the search results, you can now see the `X-MSEdge-ClientID` header (among others) and verify that it is the same for each request.
