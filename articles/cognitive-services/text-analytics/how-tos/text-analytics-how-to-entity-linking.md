# How to identify linked entities in Text Analytics (Preview)

The [Entity Linking API](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics.V2.0/operations/5ac4251d5b4ccd1554da7634) takes unstructured text, and for each JSON document, returns a list of disambiguated entities with links to more information on the web (Wikipedia and Bing). 

## Entity Linking vs. Named Entity Recognition

In natural language processing, the concepts of entity linking and named entity recognition (NER) can easily be confused. In the preview version of Text Analytics' `entities` endpoint, only entity linking is supported.

Entity linking is the ability to identify and disambiguate the identity of an entity found in text (e.g. determining whether the "Mars" is being used as the planet or as the Roman god of war). This process requires the presence of a knowledge base to which recognized entities are linked - Wikipedia is used as the knowledge base for the `entities` endpoint Text Analytics.

### Language support

Using entity linking in various languages requires using a corresponding knowledge base in each language. For entity linking in Text Analytics, this means each language that is supported by the `entities` endpoint will link to the corresponding Wikipedia corpus in that language. Since the size of corpora varies between languages, it is expected that the entity linking functionality's recall will also vary.


## Preparation

You must have JSON documents in this format: id, text, language

For currently supported languages, please see [this list](../text-analytics-supported-languages.md).

Document size must be under 5,000 characters per document, and you can have up to 1,000 items (IDs) per collection. The collection is submitted in the body of the request. The following example is an illustration of content you might submit to the entity linking end.

```
{"documents": [{"id": "1",
				"language": "en",
                "text": "I really enjoy the new XBox One S. It has a clean look, it has 4K/HDR resolution and it is affordable."
				},
               {"id": "2",
            	"language": "en",
                "text": "The Seattle Seahawks won the Super Bowl in 2014."
                }
               ]
}
```    
    
## Step 1: Structure the request

Details on request definition can be found in [How to call the Text Analytics API](text-analytics-how-to-call-api.md). The following points are restated for convenience:

+ Create a **POST** request. Review the API documentation for this request: [Entity Linking API](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics.V2.0/operations/5ac4251d5b4ccd1554da7634)

+ Set the HTTP endpoint for key phrase extraction. It must include the `/entities` resource: `https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/text/analytics/v2.0/entities`

+ Set a request header to include the access key for Text Analytics operations. For more information, see [How to find endpoints and access keys](text-analytics-how-to-access-key.md).

+ In the request body, provide the JSON documents collection you prepared for this analysis

> [!Tip]
> Use [Postman](text-analytics-how-to-call-api.md) or open the **API testing console** in the [documentation](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics.V2.0/operations/5ac4251d5b4ccd1554da7634) to structure a request and POST it to the service.

## Step 2: Post the request

Analysis is performed upon receipt of the request. The service accepts up to 100 requests per minute. Each request can be a maximum of 1 MB.

Recall that the service is stateless. No data is stored in your account. Results are returned immediately in the response.

## Step 3: View results

All POST requests return a JSON formatted response with the IDs and detected properties.

Output is returned immediately. You can stream the results to an application that accepts JSON or save the output to a file on the local system, and then import it into an application that allows you to sort, search, and manipulate the data.

An example of the output for entity linking is shown next:

```
{
    "documents": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "entities": [
                {
                    "name": "Xbox One",
                    "matches": [
                        {
                            "text": "XBox One",
                            "offset": 23,

                        }

                },
                {
                    "name": "Ultra-high-definition television",
                    "matches": [
                        {
                            "text": "4K",
                            "offset": 63,
                            "length": 2
                        }
                    ],
                    "wikipediaLanguage": "en",
                    "wikipediaId": "Ultra-high-definition television",
                    "wikipediaUrl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-definition_television",
                    "bingId": "7ee02026-b6ec-878b-f4de-f0bc7b0ab8c4"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "id": "2",
            "entities": [
                {
                    "name": "2013 Seattle Seahawks season",
                    "matches": [
                        {
                            "text": "Seattle Seahawks",
                            "offset": 4,
                            "length": 16
                        }
                    ],
                    "wikipediaLanguage": "en",
                    "wikipediaId": "2013 Seattle Seahawks season",
                    "wikipediaUrl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Seattle_Seahawks_season",
                    "bingId": "eb637865-4722-4eca-be9e-0ac0c376d361"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "errors": []
}
```

When available, the response includes the Wikipedia ID, Wikipedia URL, and Bing ID for each detected entity. These can be used to further enhance your application with information regarding the linked entity.
