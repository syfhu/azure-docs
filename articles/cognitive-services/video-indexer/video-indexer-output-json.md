# Examine the Video Indexer output produced by v1 API

> [!Note]
> The Video Indexer V1 APIs are now deprecated, and will be removed on August 1st, 2018. You should start using the Video Indexer v2 APIs to avoid disruptions.
>
> To develop with Video Indexer v2 APIs, please refer to the instructions found [here](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/). 

When you call the **Get Breakdowns** API and the response status is OK, you get a detailed JSON output as the response content. The JSON content contains details of the specified video insights including (transcript, OCRs, people). The details include keywords (topics), faces, blocks. Each block includes time ranges, transcript lines, OCR lines, sentiments, faces, and block thumbnails.

You can use the **Get Breakdowns** API to get the full breakdown of a video as a JSON content.  
 
	GET https://videobreakdown.azure-api.net/Breakdowns/Api/Partner/Breakdowns/63c6d532ff HTTP/1.1
	Host: videobreakdown.azure-api.net
	Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
	
You can also visually examine the video's summarized insights by pressing the **Play** button on the video in the Video Indexer portal. For more information, see [View and edit video insights](video-indexer-view-edit.md).

This article examines the JSON content returned by the  **Get Breakdowns** API. It might be helpful, to review the [concepts](video-indexer-concepts.md) article.
