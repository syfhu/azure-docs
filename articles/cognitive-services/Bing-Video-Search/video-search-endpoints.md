# Video Search endpoints
The **Video Search API**  includes three endpoints.  Endpoint 1 returns videos from the Web based on a query. Endpoint 2 returns insights about a video based on the `modules` URL parameter.  Endpoint 3 returns trending images.

## Endpoints
To get video results using the Bing API, send a `GET` request to one of the following endpoints. Use the headers and URL parameters to define further specifications.

**Endpoint1:** Returns videos that are relevant to the user's search query defined by `?q=""`.
``` 
GET https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/videos/search
```

**Endpoint 2:** Returns insights about a video, such as related videos. Include the `modules` [query parameter](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#query-parameters), which is a comma-delimited list of insights to request.
``` 
GET https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/videos/details
```

**Endpoint 3:** Returns videos that are trending based on search requests made by others. The videos are separated into different categories, for example, based on noteworthy people or events.
```
GET https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/videos/trending
```

For details about headers, parameters, market codes, response objects, errors, etc., see the [Bing Video Search API v7](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference) reference.
## Response JSON
The response to a videos search request includes results as JSON objects. For examples of parsing the results see the [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-video-search/tutorial-bing-video-search-single-page-app) and [source code](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-video-search/tutorial-bing-video-search-single-page-app-source).

## Next steps
The **Bing** APIs support search actions that return results according to their type. All search endpoints return results as JSON response objects.  All endpoints support queries that return a specific language and/or location by longitude, latitude, and search radius.

For complete information about the parameters supported by each endpoint, see the reference pages for each type.
