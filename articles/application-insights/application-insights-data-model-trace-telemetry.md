# Trace telemetry: Application Insights data model

Trace telemetry (in [Application Insights](app-insights-overview.md)) represents `printf` style trace statements that are text-searched. `Log4Net`, `NLog`, and other text-based log file entries are translated into instances of this type. The trace does not have measurements as an extensibility.

## Message

Trace message.

Max length: 32768 characters

## Severity level

Trace severity level. Value can be `Verbose`, `Information`, `Warning`, `Error`, `Critical`.

## Custom properties

[!INCLUDE [application-insights-data-model-properties](../../includes/application-insights-data-model-properties.md)]
