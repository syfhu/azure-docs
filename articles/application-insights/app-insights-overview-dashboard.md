# Application Insights Overview dashboard

Application Insights has always provided a summary overview pane to allow quick, at-a-glance assessment of your application's health and performance. The new overview dashboard provides a faster more flexible experience.

## How do I test out the new experience?

The new overview dashboard now launches by default:

## Better performance

Time range selection has been simplified to a simple one-click interface.

Overall performance has been greatly increased. You have one-click access to popular features like **Search** and **Analytics**. Each default dynamically updating KPI tile provides insight into corresponding Application Insights features. To learn more about failed requests select **Failures** under the **Investigate** header:

## Application dashboard

Application dashboard leverages the existing dashboard technology within Azure to provide a fully customizable single pane view of your application health and performance.

To access the default dashboard select _Application Dashboard_ in the upper left corner.

If this is your first time accessing the dashboard, it will launch a default view:

You can keep the default view if you like it. Or you can also add, and delete from the dashboard to best fit the needs of your team.

> [!NOTE]
> All users with access to the Application Insights resource share the same Application dashboard experience. Changes made by one user will modify the view for all users.

To navigate back to the overview experience just select:
