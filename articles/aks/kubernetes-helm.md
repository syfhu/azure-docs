# Use Helm with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

[Helm][helm] is an open-source packaging tool that helps you install and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes applications. Similar to Linux package managers such as *APT* and *Yum*, Helm is used to manage Kubernetes charts, which are packages of preconfigured Kubernetes resources.

This document steps through configuring and using Helm in a Kubernetes cluster on AKS.

## Before you begin

The steps detailed in this document assume that you have created an AKS cluster and have established a kubectl connection with the cluster. If you need these items see, the [AKS quickstart][aks-quickstart].

## Install Helm CLI

The Helm CLI is a client that runs on your development system and allows you to start, stop, and manage applications with Helm.

If you're using Azure CloudShell, the Helm CLI is already installed. To install the Helm CLI on a Mac use `brew`. For additional installation options see, [Installing Helm][helm-install-options].

```console
brew install kubernetes-helm
```

Output:

```

```

## Create service account

Before configuring Helm in an RBAC enabled cluster, you need a service account and role binding for the Tiller service. For more information on securing Helm / Tiller in an RBAC enabled cluster, see [Tiller, Namespaces, and RBAC][tiller-rbac]. Note, if your cluster is not RBAC enabled, skip this step.

Create a file named `helm-rbac.yaml` and copy in the following YAML.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: tiller
  namespace: kube-system
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: tiller
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: tiller
    namespace: kube-system
```

Create the service account and role binding with the `kubectl create` command.

```
kubectl create -f helm-rbac.yaml
```

When using an RBAC enabled cluster, you have options on the level of access Tiller has to the cluster. See [Helm: role-based access controls][helm-rbac] for more information on configuration options.

## Configure Helm

Now install tiller using the [helm init][helm-init] command. If your cluster is not RBAC enabled, remove the `--service-account` argument and value.

```
helm init --service-account tiller
```

## Find Helm charts

Helm charts are used to deploy applications into a Kubernetes cluster. To search for pre-created Helm charts, use the [helm search][helm-search] command.

```azurecli-interactive
helm search
```

The output looks similar to the following, however with many more charts.

```

...
```

To update the list of charts, use the [helm repo update][helm-repo-update] command.

```azurecli-interactive
helm repo update
```

Output:

```
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Skip local chart repository
...Successfully got an update from the "stable" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈ Happy Helming!⎈
```

## Run Helm charts

To deploy Wordpress using a Helm chart, use the [helm install][helm-install] command.

```azurecli-interactive
helm install stable/wordpress
```

The output looks similar to the following, but includes additional information such as instructions on how to use the Kubernetes deployment.

## List Helm releases

To see a list of releases installed on your cluster, use the [helm list][helm-list] command.

```azurecli-interactive
helm list
```

Output:

```
