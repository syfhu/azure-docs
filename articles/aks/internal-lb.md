# Use an internal load balancer with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Internal load balancing makes a Kubernetes service accessible to applications running in the same virtual network as the Kubernetes cluster. This document details creating an internal load balancer with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Azure Load Balancer is available in two SKUs: Basic and Standard. AKS uses the Basic SKU.

## Create internal load balancer

To create an internal load balancer, build a service manifest with the service type `LoadBalancer` and the `azure-load-balancer-internal` annotation as seen in the following sample.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-front
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true"
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: azure-vote-front
```

Once deployed, an Azure load balancer is created and made available on the same virtual network as the AKS cluster.

When retrieving the service details, the IP address in the `EXTERNAL-IP` column is the IP address of the internal load balancer.

```console
$ kubectl get service azure-vote-front

NAME               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
azure-vote-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.248.59   10.240.0.7    80:30555/TCP   10s
```

## Specify an IP address

If you would like to use a specific IP address with the internal load balancer, add the `loadBalancerIP` property to the load balancer spec. The specified IP address must reside in the same subnet as the AKS cluster and must not already be assigned to a resource.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-front
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true"
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  loadBalancerIP: 10.240.0.25
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: azure-vote-front
```

When retrieving the service details, the IP address on the `EXTERNAL-IP` should reflect the specified IP address.

```console
$ kubectl get service azure-vote-front

NAME               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
azure-vote-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.184.168   10.240.0.25   80:30225/TCP   4m
```

## Delete the load balancer

When all services using the internal load balancer have been deleted, the load balancer itself is also deleted.
