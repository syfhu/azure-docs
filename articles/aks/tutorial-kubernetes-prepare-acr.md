# Tutorial: Deploy and use Azure Container Registry

Azure Container Registry (ACR) is an Azure-based, private registry, for Docker container images. This tutorial, part two of seven, walks through deploying an Azure Container Registry instance, and pushing a container image to it. Steps completed include:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deploying an Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance
> * Tagging a container image for ACR
> * Uploading the image to ACR

In subsequent tutorials, this ACR instance is integrated with a Kubernetes cluster in AKS.

## Before you begin

In the [previous tutorial][aks-tutorial-prepare-app], a container image was created for a simple Azure Voting application. If you have not created the Azure Voting app image, return to [Tutorial 1 – Create container images][aks-tutorial-prepare-app].

This tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.27 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

## Deploy Azure Container Registry

When deploying an Azure Container Registry, you first need a resource group. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

Create a resource group with the [az group create][az-group-create] command. In this example, a resource group named `myResourceGroup` is created in the `eastus` region.

```azurecli
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

Create an Azure Container registry with the [az acr create][az-acr-create] command. The registry name must be unique within Azure, and contain 5-50 alphanumeric characters.

```azurecli
az acr create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name <acrName> --sku Basic
```

Throughout the rest of this tutorial, we use `<acrName>` as a placeholder for the container registry name.

## Container registry login

Use the [az acr login][az-acr-login] command to log in to the ACR instance. You need to provide the unique name given to the container registry when it was created.

```azurecli
az acr login --name <acrName>
```

The command returns a 'Login Succeeded’ message once completed.

## Tag container images

To see a list of current images, use the [docker images][docker-images] command.

```console
docker images
```

Output:

```
REPOSITORY                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
azure-vote-front             latest              4675398c9172        13 minutes ago      694MB
redis                        latest              a1b99da73d05        7 days ago          106MB
tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask   flask               788ca94b2313        9 months ago        694MB
```

Each container image needs to be tagged with the loginServer name of the registry. This tag is used for routing when pushing container images to an image registry.

Use the [az acr list][az-acr-list] command to get the loginServer name.

```azurecli
az acr list --resource-group myResourceGroup --query "[].{acrLoginServer:loginServer}" --output table
```

Now, tag the `azure-vote-front` image with the loginServer of the container registry. Also, add `:v1` to the end of the image name. This tag indicates the image version.

```console
docker tag azure-vote-front <acrLoginServer>/azure-vote-front:v1
```

Once tagged, run [docker images][docker-images] to verify the operation.

```console
docker images
```

Output:

```
REPOSITORY                                           TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
azure-vote-front                                     latest              eaf2b9c57e5e        8 minutes ago       716 MB
mycontainerregistry082.azurecr.io/azure-vote-front   v1            eaf2b9c57e5e        8 minutes ago       716 MB
redis                                                latest              a1b99da73d05        7 days ago          106MB
tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask                           flask               788ca94b2313        8 months ago        694 MB
```

## Push images to registry

Push the `azure-vote-front` image to the registry.

Using the following example, replace the ACR loginServer name with the loginServer from your environment.

```console
docker push <acrLoginServer>/azure-vote-front:v1
```

This takes a couple of minutes to complete.

## List images in registry

To return a list of images that have been pushed to your Azure Container registry, user the [az acr repository list][az-acr-repository-list] command. Update the command with the ACR instance name.

```azurecli
az acr repository list --name <acrName> --output table
```

Output:

```azurecli
Result
----------------
azure-vote-front
```

And then to see the tags for a specific image, use the [az acr repository show-tags][az-acr-repository-show-tags] command.

```azurecli
az acr repository show-tags --name <acrName> --repository azure-vote-front --output table
```

Output:

```azurecli
Result
--------
v1
```

At tutorial completion, the container image has been stored in a private Azure Container Registry instance. This image is deployed from ACR to a Kubernetes cluster in subsequent tutorials.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, an Azure Container Registry was prepared for use in an AKS cluster. The following steps were completed:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deployed an Azure Container Registry instance
> * Tagged a container image for ACR
> * Uploaded the image to ACR

Advance to the next tutorial to learn about deploying a Kubernetes cluster in Azure.
