# Publish and manage an offer in the Azure Marketplace
This article is provided to help developers create, deploy, and manage their solutions listed in the Azure Marketplace for other Azure customers and partners to purchase and use.

## Marketplace publishing
As an Azure publisher, you can distribute and sell your innovative solution or service to other developers, ISVs, and IT professionals in the Marketplace. Through the Marketplace, you can reach customers who want to quickly develop their cloud-based applications and mobile solutions. If your solution targets business users, you might want to consider the [AppSource](http://appsource.microsoft.com) marketplace.


## Supported types of solutions
The first thing you want to do as a publisher is to define what kind of solution your company is offering. The Marketplace supports the following types of offers:

|Solution type|Virtual machine|Solution template|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|Preconfigured images with a fully installed operating system and one or more applications. A virtual machine image provides the information necessary to create and deploy virtual machines in the Azure Virtual Machines service.|A data structure that can reference one or more distinct Azure services, including services published by other sellers. Azure subscribers can use it to deploy one or more offerings in a single, coordinated manner.|
|**Example**|As an Azure publisher, you've created and validated a VM with an innovative database service. Other Azure subscribers want to procure and deploy this VM into their cloud service environments.|As an Azure publisher, you've bundled a set of services from across Azure that make it quick to deploy cloud services with load balancing, enhanced security, and high availability. Other Azure subscribers can save time by procuring the solution template that meets their objective. They don't have to manually locate, procure, deploy, and configure the same or similar Azure services.|

> [!NOTE]
> Some steps are shared between the different types of solutions, and others are distinct to the respective type of solution. This article provides a short overview of the steps you need to complete for any type of solution.

## Publish a solution

### Nominate your solution for pre-approval

You can also go to the [Microsoft Azure Certified](http://createopportunity.azurewebsites.net) webpage and fill out the application form. Enter the email of your Partner Account Manager or DX Partner Manager in the **Microsoft Sponsor Contact** box.

If you meet the eligibility criteria in the [Azure Marketplace participation policies](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=526833) and your application is approved, we start working with you to onboard your solution to the Marketplace.
