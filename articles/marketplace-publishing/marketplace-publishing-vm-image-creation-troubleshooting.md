10. Every time I am trying to create an image from my VHDs, I get the error “.VHD is already registered with image repository as the resource” in PowerShell. I did not create any image before nor did I find any image with this name in Azure. How do I resolve this?
    
    This usually happen if the user provisioned a VM from this VHD and there is a lock on that VHD. Please check that there is no VM allocated from this VHD. If the error still persist , then please raise a support ticket using this link or from the Publishing portal regarding this (details are given in the answer of question 11).
