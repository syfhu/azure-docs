# Create a function triggered by a generic webhook

Azure Functions lets you execute your code in a serverless environment without having to first create a VM or publish a web application. For example, you can configure a function to be triggered by an alert raised by Azure Monitor. This topic shows you how to execute C# code when a resource group is added to your subscription.

## Prerequisites 

To complete this tutorial:

+ If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Create an Azure Function app

[!INCLUDE [Create function app Azure portal](../../includes/functions-create-function-app-portal.md)]

Next, you create a function in the new function app.

## <a name="create-function"></a>Create a generic webhook triggered function

1. Expand your function app and click the **+** button next to **Functions**. If this function is the first one in your function app, select **Custom function**. This displays the complete set of function templates.

    ![Functions quickstart page in the Azure portal](./media/functions-create-generic-webhook-triggered-function/add-first-function.png)

2. In the search field, type `generic` and then choose your desired language for the generic webhook trigger template. This topic uses a C# function.

     ![Choose the generic webhook trigger template](./media/functions-create-generic-webhook-triggered-function/functions-create-generic-webhook-trigger.png)

2. Type a **Name** for your function, then select **Create**. 

     ![Create a generic webhook triggered function in the Azure portal](./media/functions-create-generic-webhook-triggered-function/functions-create-generic-webhook-trigger-2.png) 

2. In your new function, click **</> Get function URL**, then copy and save the value. You use this value to configure the webhook. 

    ![Review the function code](./media/functions-create-generic-webhook-triggered-function/functions-copy-function-url.png)
         
Next, you create a webhook endpoint in an activity log alert in Azure Monitor. 

## Create an activity log alert

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Monitor** service, select **Alerts**, and click **Add activity log alert**.   

    ![Monitor](./media/functions-create-generic-webhook-triggered-function/functions-monitor-add-alert.png)

2. Use the settings as specified in the table:

    ![Create an activity log alert](./media/functions-create-generic-webhook-triggered-function/functions-monitor-add-alert-settings.png)

    | Setting      |  Suggested value   | Description                              |
    | ------------ |  ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Activity log alert name** | resource-group-create-alert | Name of the activity log alert. |
    | **Subscription** | Your subscription | The subscription you are using for this tutorial. | 
    |  **Resource Group** | myResourceGroup | The resource group that the alert resources are deployed to. Using the same resource group as your function app makes it easier to clean up after you complete the tutorial. |
    | **Event category** | Administrative | This category includes changes made to Azure resources.  |
    | **Resource type** | Resource groups | Filters alerts to resource group activities. |
    | **Resource Group**<br/>and **Resource** | All | Monitor all resources. |
    | **Operation name** | Create Resource Group | Filters alerts to create operations. |
    | **Level** | Informational | Include informational level alerts. | 
    | **Status** | Succeeded | Filters alerts to actions that have completed successfully. |
    | **Action group** | New | Create a new action group, which defines the action takes when an alert is raised. |
    | **Action group name** | function-webhook | A name to identify the action group.  | 
    | **Short name** | funcwebhook | A short name for the action group. |  

3. In **Actions**, add an action using the settings as specified in the table: 

    ![Add an action group](./media/functions-create-generic-webhook-triggered-function/functions-monitor-add-alert-settings-2.png)

    | Setting      |  Suggested value   | Description                              |
    | ------------ |  ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Name** | CallFunctionWebhook | A name for the action. |
    | **Action type** | Webhook | The response to the alert is that a Webhook URL is called. |
    | **Details** | Function URL | Paste in the webhook URL of the function that you copied earlier. |v

4. Click **OK** to create the alert and action group.  

The webhook is now called when a resource group is created in your subscription. Next, you update the code in your function to handle the JSON log data in the body of the request.   

## Update the function code

1. Navigate back to your function app in the portal, and expand your function. 

2. Replace the C# script code in the function in the portal with the following code:

    ```csharp
    #r "Newtonsoft.Json"
    
    using System;
    using System.Net;
    using Newtonsoft.Json;
    using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;
    
    public static async Task<object> Run(HttpRequestMessage req, TraceWriter log)
    {
        log.Info($"Webhook was triggered!");
    
        // Get the activityLog object from the JSON in the message body.
        string jsonContent = await req.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        JToken activityLog = JObject.Parse(jsonContent.ToString())
            .SelectToken("data.context.activityLog");
    
        // Return an error if the resource in the activity log isn't a resource group. 
        if (activityLog == null || !string.Equals((string)activityLog["resourceType"], 
            "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourcegroups"))
        {
            log.Error("An error occurred");
            return req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest, new
            {
                error = "Unexpected message payload or wrong alert received."
            });
        }
    
        // Write information about the created resource group to the streaming log.
        log.Info(string.Format("Resource group '{0}' was {1} on {2}.",
            (string)activityLog["resourceGroupName"],
            ((string)activityLog["subStatus"]).ToLower(), 
            (DateTime)activityLog["submissionTimestamp"]));
    
        return req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);    
    }
    ```

Now you can test the function by creating a new resource group in your subscription.

## Test the function

1. Click the resource group icon in the left of the Azure portal, select **+ Add**, type a **Resource group name**, and select **Create** to create an empty resource group.
    
    ![Create a resource group.](./media/functions-create-generic-webhook-triggered-function/functions-create-resource-group.png)

2. Go back to your function and expand the **Logs** window. After the resource group is created, the activity log alert triggers the webhook and the function executes. You see the name of the new resource group written to the logs.  

    ![Add a test application setting.](./media/functions-create-generic-webhook-triggered-function/function-view-logs.png)

3. (Optional) Go back and delete the resource group that you created. Note that this activity doesn't trigger the function. This is because delete operations are filtered out by the alert. 

## Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [Next steps note](../../includes/functions-quickstart-cleanup.md)]

## Next steps

You have created a function that runs when a request is received from a generic webhook.
