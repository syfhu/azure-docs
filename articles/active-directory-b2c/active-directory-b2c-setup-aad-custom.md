# Azure Active Directory B2C: Sign in by using Azure AD accounts

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-advanced-audience-warning](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-advanced-audience-warning.md)]

This article shows you how to enable sign-in for users from a specific Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) organization through the use of [custom policies](active-directory-b2c-overview-custom.md).

## Prerequisites

Complete the steps in the [Getting started with custom policies](active-directory-b2c-get-started-custom.md) article.

These steps include:

1. Creating an Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) tenant.
2. Creating an Azure AD B2C application.
3. Registering two policy-engine applications.
4. Setting up keys.
5. Setting up the starter pack.

## Create an Azure AD app

To enable sign-in for users from a specific Azure AD organization, you need to register an application within the organizational Azure AD tenant.

>[!NOTE]
> We use "contoso.com" for the organizational Azure AD tenant and "fabrikamb2c.onmicrosoft.com" as the Azure AD B2C tenant in the following instructions.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. On the top bar, select your account. From the **Directory** list, choose the organizational Azure AD tenant where you want to register your application (contoso.com).
3. Select **More services** in the left pane, and search for "App registrations."
4. Select **New application registration**.
5. Enter a name for your application (for example, `Azure AD B2C App`).
6. Select **Web app / API** for the application type.
7. For **Sign-on URL**, enter the following URL, where `yourtenant` is replaced by the name of your Azure AD B2C tenant (`fabrikamb2c.onmicrosoft.com`):

    >[!NOTE]
    >The value for "yourtenant" must be all lowercase in the **Sign-on URL**.

    ```
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/te/yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp
    ```

8. Save the application ID.
9. Select the newly created application.
10. Under the **Settings** blade, select **Keys**.
11. Enter the key description, select a duration, and then click **Save**. The value of the key is displayed. Copy it because you will use it in the steps in the next section.

## Add the Azure AD key to Azure AD B2C

You need to store the contoso.com application key in your Azure AD B2C tenant. To do this:
1. Go to your Azure AD B2C tenant, and select **B2C Settings** > **Identity Experience Framework** > **Policy Keys**.
1. Select **+Add**.
1. Select or enter these options:
   * Select **Manual**.
   * For **Name**, choose a name that matches your Azure AD tenant name (for example, `ContosoAppSecret`).  The prefix `B2C_1A_` is added automatically to the name of your key.
   * Paste your application key in the **Secret** box.
   * Select **Signature**.
1. Select **Create**.
1. Confirm that you've created the key `B2C_1A_ContosoAppSecret`.


## Add a claims provider in your base policy

If you want users to sign in by using Azure AD, you need to define Azure AD as a claims provider. In other words, you need to specify an endpoint that Azure AD B2C will communicate with. The endpoint will provide a set of claims that are used by Azure AD B2C to verify that a specific user has authenticated. 

You can define Azure AD as a claims provider by adding Azure AD to the `<ClaimsProvider>` node in the extension file of your policy:

1. Open the extension file (TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml) from your working directory.
1. Find the `<ClaimsProviders>` section. If it does not exist, add it under the root node.
1. Add a new `<ClaimsProvider>` node as follows:

    ```XML
    <ClaimsProvider>
        <Domain>Contoso</Domain>
        <DisplayName>Login using Contoso</DisplayName>
        <TechnicalProfiles>
            <TechnicalProfile Id="ContosoProfile">
                <DisplayName>Contoso Employee</DisplayName>
                <Description>Login with your Contoso account</Description>
                <Protocol Name="OpenIdConnect"/>
                <OutputTokenFormat>JWT</OutputTokenFormat>
                <Metadata>
                    <Item Key="METADATA">https://login.windows.net/contoso.com/.well-known/openid-configuration</Item>
                    <Item Key="ProviderName">https://sts.windows.net/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/</Item>
                    <Item Key="client_id">00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000</Item>
                    <Item Key="IdTokenAudience">00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000</Item>
                    <Item Key="response_types">id_token</Item>
                    <Item Key="UsePolicyInRedirectUri">false</Item>
                </Metadata>
                <CryptographicKeys>
                    <Key Id="client_secret" StorageReferenceId="B2C_1A_ContosoAppSecret"/>
                </CryptographicKeys>
                <OutputClaims>
                    <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="socialIdpUserId" PartnerClaimType="oid"/>
                    <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="tenantId" PartnerClaimType="tid"/>
                    <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="givenName" PartnerClaimType="given_name" />
                    <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="surName" PartnerClaimType="family_name" />
                    <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="displayName" PartnerClaimType="name" />
                    <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="authenticationSource" DefaultValue="contosoAuthentication" />
                    <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="identityProvider" DefaultValue="AzureADContoso" />
                </OutputClaims>
                <OutputClaimsTransformations>
                    <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateRandomUPNUserName"/>
                    <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateUserPrincipalName"/>
                    <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateAlternativeSecurityId"/>
                    <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateSubjectClaimFromAlternativeSecurityId"/>
                </OutputClaimsTransformations>
                <UseTechnicalProfileForSessionManagement ReferenceId="SM-Noop"/>
            </TechnicalProfile>
        </TechnicalProfiles>
    </ClaimsProvider>
    ```

1. Under the `<ClaimsProvider>` node, update the value for `<Domain>` to a unique value that can be used to distinguish it from other identity providers.
1. Under the `<ClaimsProvider>` node, update the value for `<DisplayName>` to a friendly name for the claims provider. This value is not currently used.

### Update the technical profile

To get a token from the Azure AD endpoint, you need to define the protocols that Azure AD B2C should use to communicate with Azure AD. This is done inside the `<TechnicalProfile>` element of  `<ClaimsProvider>`.
1. Update the ID of the `<TechnicalProfile>` node. This ID is used to refer to this technical profile from other parts of the policy.
1. Update the value for `<DisplayName>`. This value will be displayed on the sign-in button on your sign-in screen.
1. Update the value for `<Description>`.
1. Azure AD uses the OpenID Connect protocol, so ensure that the value for `<Protocol>` is `"OpenIdConnect"`.

You need to update the `<Metadata>` section in the XML file referred to earlier to reflect the configuration settings for your specific Azure AD tenant. In the XML file, update the metadata values as follows:

1. Set `<Item Key="METADATA">` to `https://login.windows.net/yourAzureADtenant/.well-known/openid-configuration`, where `yourAzureADtenant` is your Azure AD tenant name (contoso.com).
1. Open your browser and go to the `METADATA` URL that you just updated.
1. In the browser, look for the 'issuer' object and copy its value. It should look like the following: `https://sts.windows.net/{tenantId}/`.
1. Paste the value for `<Item Key="ProviderName">` in the XML file.
1. Set `<Item Key="client_id">` to the application ID from the app registration.
1. Set `<Item Key="IdTokenAudience">` to the application ID from the app registration.
1. Ensure that `<Item Key="response_types">` is set to `id_token`.
1. Ensure that `<Item Key="UsePolicyInRedirectUri">` is set to `false`.

You also need to link the Azure AD secret that you registered in your Azure AD B2C tenant to the Azure AD `<ClaimsProvider>` information:

* In the `<CryptographicKeys>` section in the preceding XML file, update the value for `StorageReferenceId` to the reference ID of the secret that you defined (for example, `ContosoAppSecret`).

### Upload the extension file for verification

By now, you have configured your policy so that Azure AD B2C knows how to communicate with your Azure AD directory. Try uploading the extension file of your policy just to confirm that it doesn't have any issues so far. To do so:

1. Open the **All Policies** blade in your Azure AD B2C tenant.
1. Check the **Overwrite the policy if it exists** box.
1. Upload the extension file (TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml), and ensure that it does not fail the validation.

## Register the Azure AD claims provider to a user journey

You now need to add the Azure AD identity provider to one of your user journeys. At this point, the identity provider has been set up, but it’s not available in any of the sign-up/sign-in screens. To make it available, we will create a duplicate of an existing template user journey, and then modify it so that it also has the Azure AD identity provider:

1. Open the base file of your policy (for example, TrustFrameworkBase.xml).
1. Find the `<UserJourneys>` element and copy the entire `<UserJourney>` node that includes `Id="SignUpOrSignIn"`.
1. Open the extension file (for example, TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml) and find the `<UserJourneys>` element. If the element doesn't exist, add one.
1. Paste the entire `<UserJourney>` node that you copied as a child of the `<UserJourneys>` element.
1. Rename the ID of the new user journey (for example, rename as `SignUpOrSignUsingContoso`).

### Display the "button"

The `<ClaimsProviderSelection>` element is analogous to an identity provider button on a sign-up/sign-in screen. If you add a `<ClaimsProviderSelection>` element for Azure AD, a new button shows up when a user lands on the page. To add this element:

1. Find the `<OrchestrationStep>` node that includes `Order="1"` in the user journey that you just created.
1. Add the following:

    ```XML
    <ClaimsProviderSelection TargetClaimsExchangeId="ContosoExchange" />
    ```

1. Set `TargetClaimsExchangeId` to an appropriate value. We recommend following the same convention as others: *\[ClaimProviderName\]Exchange*.

### Link the button to an action

Now that you have a button in place, you need to link it to an action. The action, in this case, is for Azure AD B2C to communicate with Azure AD to receive a token. Link the button to an action by linking the technical profile for your Azure AD claims provider:

1. Find the `<OrchestrationStep>` that includes `Order="2"` in the `<UserJourney>` node.
1. Add the following:

    ```XML
    <ClaimsExchange Id="ContosoExchange" TechnicalProfileReferenceId="ContosoProfile" />
    ```

1. Update `Id` to the same value as that of `TargetClaimsExchangeId` in the preceding section.
1. Update `TechnicalProfileReferenceId` to the ID of the technical profile you created earlier (ContosoProfile).

### Upload the updated extension file

You are done modifying the extension file. Save it. Then upload the file, and ensure that all validations succeed.

### Update the RP file

You now need to update the relying party (RP) file that will initiate the user journey that you just created:

1. Make a copy of SignUpOrSignIn.xml in your working directory, and rename it (for example, rename it to SignUpOrSignInWithAAD.xml).
1. Open the new file and update the `PolicyId` attribute for `<TrustFrameworkPolicy>` with a unique value (for example, SignUpOrSignInWithAAD). <br> This will be the name of your policy (for example, B2C\_1A\_SignUpOrSignInWithAAD).
1. Modify the `ReferenceId` attribute in `<DefaultUserJourney>` to match the ID of the new user journey that you created (SignUpOrSignUsingContoso).
1. Save your changes, and upload the file.

## Troubleshooting

Test the custom policy that you just uploaded by opening its blade and clicking **Run now**. To diagnose problems, read about [troubleshooting](active-directory-b2c-troubleshoot-custom.md).
