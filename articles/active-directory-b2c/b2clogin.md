# Using b2clogin.com

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This feature is public preview 
>

You now have the option to use the Azure AD B2C service with `<YourTenantName>.b2clogin.com` instead of using `login.microsoftonline.com`.  This has many benefits:
* You no longer share the same cookie header size limit with the other Microsoft products.
* You can remove all references to Microsoft in your URL (you can replace `<YourTenantName>.onmicrosoft.com` with your tenant ID). For example: `https://<tenantname>.b2clogin.com/tfp/<tenantname>/<policyname>/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

 In order to take advantage of b2clogin.com, you need to set some of the following:

1. For your **Run now endpoint** make sure you are using `<YourTenantName>.b2clogin.com` instead of using `login.microsoftonline.com`.
2. If you are using MSAL, you need to set `validateauthority=false`.  This is because the token issuer becomes`<YourTenantName>.b2clogin.com`.
