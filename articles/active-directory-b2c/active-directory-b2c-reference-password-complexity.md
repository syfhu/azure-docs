# Azure AD B2C: Configure complexity requirements for passwords

> [!NOTE]
> **This feature is in public preview.**

Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) supports changing the complexity requirements for passwords supplied by an end user when creating an account.  By default, Azure AD B2C uses `Strong` passwords.  Azure AD B2C also supports configuration options to control the complexity of passwords that customers can use.

## When password rules are enforced

During sign-up or password reset, an end user must supply a password that meets the complexity rules.  Password complexity rules are enforced per policy.  It is possible to have one policy require a four-digit pin during sign-up while another policy requires a eight character string during sign-up.  For example, you may use a policy with different password complexity for adults than for children.

Password complexity is never enforced during sign-in.  Users are never prompted during sign-in to change their password because it doesn't meet the current complexity requirement.

Here are the types of policies where password complexity can be configured:

* Sign-up or Sign-in Policy
* Password Reset Policy
* Custom Policy ([Configure password complexity in custom policy](active-directory-b2c-reference-password-complexity-custom.md))

## How to configure password complexity

1. Follow these steps to [navigate to Azure AD B2C settings](active-directory-b2c-app-registration.md#navigate-to-b2c-settings).
1. Open **Sign-up or sign-in polices**.
1. Select a policy, and click **Edit**.
1. Open **Password complexity**.
1. Change the password complexity for this policy to **Simple**, **Strong**, or **Custom**.

### Comparison Chart

| Complexity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Simple | A password that is at least 8 to 64 characters. |
| Strong | A password that is at least 8 to 64 characters. It requires 3 out of 4 of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, or symbols. |
| Custom | This option provides the most control over password complexity rules.  It allows configuring a custom length.  It also allows accepting number-only passwords (pins). |

## Options available under custom

### Character Set

Allows you to accept digits only (pins) or the full character set.

* **Numbers only** allows digits only (0-9) while entering a password.
* **All** allows any letter, number, or symbol.

### Length

Allows you to control the length requirements of the password.

* **Minimum Length** must be at least 4.
* **Maximum Length** must be greater or equal to minimum length and at most can be 64 characters.

### Character classes

Allows you to control the different character types used in the password.

* **2 of 4: Lowercase character, Uppercase character, Number (0-9), Symbol** ensures the password contains at least two character types. For example, a number and a lowercase character.
* **3 of 4: Lowercase character, Uppercase character, Number (0-9), Symbol** ensures the password contains at least two character types. For example, a number, a lowercase character and an uppercase character.
* **4 of 4: Lowercase character, Uppercase character, Number (0-9), Symbol** ensures the password contains all for character types.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Requiring **4 of 4** can result in end-user frustration. Some studies have shown that this requirement does not improve password entropy. See [NIST Password Guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#appA)
