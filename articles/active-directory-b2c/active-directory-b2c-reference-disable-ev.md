# Azure Active Directory B2C: Disable email verification during consumer sign-up
When enabled, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2C gives a consumer the ability to sign up for applications by providing an email address and creating a local account. Azure AD B2C ensures valid email addresses by requiring consumers to verify them during the sign-up process. It also prevents a malicious automated process from generating fake accounts for the applications.

Some application developers prefer to skip email verification during the sign-up process and instead have consumers verify the email address later. To support this, Azure AD B2C can be configured to disable email verification. Doing so creates a smoother sign-up process and gives developers the flexibility to differentiate the consumers that have verified their email address from those consumers that have not.

By default, sign-up policies have email verification turned on. Use the following steps to turn it off:

1. [Follow these steps to navigate to the B2C features blade on the Azure portal](active-directory-b2c-app-registration.md#navigate-to-b2c-settings).
2. Click **Sign-up policies** or **Sign-up or sign-in policies** depending on what you configured for sign-up.
3. Click your policy (for example, "B2C_1_SiUp") to open it. Click **Edit** at the top of the blade.
4. Click **Page UI Customization**.
5. Click **Local account sign-up page**.
6. Click **Email Address** in the **Name** column under the **Sign-up attributes** section.
7. Toggle the **Require verification** option to **No**.
8. Click **OK** at the bottom until you reach the **Edit policy** blade.
9. Click **Save** at the top of the blade. You're done!

> [!NOTE]
> Disabling email verification in the sign-up process may lead to spam. If you disable the default one, we recommend adding your own verification system.
