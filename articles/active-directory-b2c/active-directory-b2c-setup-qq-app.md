## Create a QQ application

To use QQ as an identity provider in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2C, you need to create a QQ application and supply it with the right parameters. You need a QQ account to do this. If you don’t have one, you can get one at [https://ssl.zc.qq.com/en/index.html?type=1&ptlang=1033](https://ssl.zc.qq.com/en/index.html?type=1&ptlang=1033).

### Register for the QQ developer program

1. Go to the [QQ developer portal](http://open.qq.com) and sign in with your QQ account credentials.
2. After signing in, go to [http://open.qq.com/reg](http://open.qq.com/reg) to register yourself as a developer.
3. In the menu, select **个人** (individual developer).
4. Enter the required information into the form and click **下一步** (next step).
