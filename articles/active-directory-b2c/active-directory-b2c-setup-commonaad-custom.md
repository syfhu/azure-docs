# Azure Active Directory B2C: Allow users to sign in to a multi-tenant Azure AD identity provider using custom policies

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-advanced-audience-warning](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-advanced-audience-warning.md)]

This article shows you how to enable sign-in for users using the multi-tenant endpoint for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) through the use of [custom policies](active-directory-b2c-overview-custom.md). This allows users from multiple Azure AD tenants to sign into Azure AD B2C without configuring a technical provider for each tenant. However, guest members in any of these tenants **will not** be able to sign in. For that, you will have to [individually configure each tenant](active-directory-b2c-setup-aad-custom.md).

>[!NOTE]
> We use "contoso.com" for the organizational Azure AD tenant and "fabrikamb2c.onmicrosoft.com" as the Azure AD B2C tenant in the following instructions.

## Prerequisites

Complete the steps in the [Getting started with custom policies](active-directory-b2c-get-started-custom.md) article.

These steps include:
 	 
1. Creating an Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) tenant.
1. Creating an Azure AD B2C application.	
1. Registering two policy-engine applications.	
1. Setting up keys.	
1. Setting up the starter pack.

## Step 1. Create a multi-tenant Azure AD app

To enable sign-in for users using the multi-tenant Azure AD endpoint, you need to have a multi-tenant application registered in one of your Azure AD tenants. In this article, we will show you how to create a multi-tenant Azure AD application in your Azure AD B2C tenant. Then enable sign-in for users through the use of that multi-tenant Azure AD application.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. On the top bar, select your account. From the **Directory** list, choose the Azure AD B2C tenant to register the Azure AD application (fabrikamb2c.onmicrosoft.com).
1. Select **More services** in the left pane, and search for "App registrations."
1. Select **New application registration**.
1. Enter a name for your application (for example, `Azure AD B2C App`).
1. Select **Web app / API** for the application type.
1. For **Sign-on URL**, enter the following URL, where `yourtenant` is replaced by the name of your Azure AD B2C tenant (`fabrikamb2c.onmicrosoft.com`):

    >[!NOTE]
    >The value for "yourtenant" must be all lowercase in the **Sign-on URL**.

    ```
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/te/yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp
    ```

1. Save the application ID.
1. Select the newly created application.
1. Under the **Settings** blade, select **Properties**.
1. Set **Multi-tenanted** to **Yes**.
1. Under the **Settings** blade, select **Keys**.
1. Create a new key, and save it. You will use it in the steps in the next section.

## Step 2. Add the Azure AD key to Azure AD B2C

You need to register the application key in the Azure AD B2C settings. To do this:

1. Go to the settings menu for Azure AD B2C
1. Click on **Identity Experience Framework** > **Policy Keys**.
1. Select **+Add**.
1. Select or enter these options:
   * Select **Manual**.
   * For **Name**, choose a name that matches your Azure AD tenant name (for example, `AADAppSecret`).  The prefix `B2C_1A_` is added automatically to the name of your key.
   * Paste your application key in the **Secret** box.
   * Select **Signature**.
1. Select **Create**.
1. Confirm that you've created the key `B2C_1A_AADAppSecret`.

## Step 3. Add a claims provider in your base policy

If you want users to sign in by using Azure AD, you need to define Azure AD as a claims provider. In other words, you need to specify an endpoint that Azure AD B2C will communicate with. The endpoint will provide a set of claims that are used by Azure AD B2C to verify that a specific user has authenticated. 

You can define Azure AD as a claims provider by adding Azure AD to the `<ClaimsProvider>` node in the extension file of your policy:

1. Open the extension file (TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml) from your working directory.
1. Find the `<ClaimsProviders>` section. If it does not exist, add it under the root node.
1. Add a new `<ClaimsProvider>` node as follows:

```XML
<ClaimsProvider>
  <Domain>commonaad</Domain>
  <DisplayName>Common AAD</DisplayName>
  <TechnicalProfiles>
    <TechnicalProfile Id="Common-AAD">
      <DisplayName>Multi-Tenant AAD</DisplayName>
      <Protocol Name="OpenIdConnect" />
      <Metadata>
        <!-- Update the Client ID below to the Application ID -->
        <Item Key="client_id">00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000</Item>
        <Item Key="UsePolicyInRedirectUri">0</Item>
        <Item Key="METADATA">https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/.well-known/openid-configuration</Item>
        <Item Key="response_types">code</Item>
        <Item Key="scope">openid</Item>
        <Item Key="response_mode">form_post</Item>
        <Item Key="HttpBinding">POST</Item>
        <Item Key="DiscoverMetadataByTokenIssuer">true</Item>
        
        <!-- The key below allows you to specify each of the Azure AD tenants that can be used to sign in. Update the GUIDs below for each tenant. -->
        <Item Key="ValidTokenIssuerPrefixes">https://sts.windows.net/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000,https://sts.windows.net/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111</Item>

        <!-- The commented key below specifies that users from any tenant can sign-in. Uncomment if you would like anyone with an Azure AD account to be able to sign in. -->
        <!-- <Item Key="ValidTokenIssuerPrefixes">https://sts.windows.net/</Item> -->

      </Metadata>
      <CryptographicKeys>
      <!-- Make sure to update the reference ID of the client secret below you just created (B2C_1A_AADAppSecret) -->
        <Key Id="client_secret" StorageReferenceId="B2C_1A_AADAppSecret" />
      </CryptographicKeys>
      <OutputClaims>
        <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="authenticationSource" DefaultValue="socialIdpAuthentication" />
        <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="identityProvider" PartnerClaimType="iss" />
        <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="socialIdpUserId" PartnerClaimType="sub" />
        <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="displayName" PartnerClaimType="name" />
        <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="givenName" PartnerClaimType="given_name" />
        <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="surName" PartnerClaimType="family_name" />
        <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="email" />
      </OutputClaims>
      <OutputClaimsTransformations>
        <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateRandomUPNUserName" />
        <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateUserPrincipalName" />
        <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateAlternativeSecurityId" />
        <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateSubjectClaimFromAlternativeSecurityId" />
      </OutputClaimsTransformations>
      <UseTechnicalProfileForSessionManagement ReferenceId="SM-SocialLogin" />
    </TechnicalProfile>
  </TechnicalProfiles>
</ClaimsProvider>
```

1. Under the `<ClaimsProvider>` node, update the value for `<Domain>` to a unique value that can be used to distinguish it from other identity providers.
1. Under the `<TechnicalProfile>` node, update the value for `<DisplayName>`. This value will be displayed on the sign-in button on your sign-in screen.
1. Update the value for `<Description>`.
1. Set `<Item Key="client_id">` to the application ID from the Azure AD mulity-tenant app registration.

### Step 3.1 Restrict access to a specific list of Azure AD tenants

> [!NOTE]
> Using `https://sts.windows.net` as the value for **ValidTokenIssuerPrefixes** will allow ALL Azure AD users to sign into your app.

You need to update the list of valid token issuers and restrict access to specific list of Azure AD tenants users can sign-in. To obtain the values, you will need to look at the metadata for each of the specific Azure AD tenants that you would like to have users sign in from. The format of the data looks like the following: `https://login.windows.net/yourAzureADtenant/.well-known/openid-configuration`, where `yourAzureADtenant` is your Azure AD tenant name (contoso.com or any other Azure AD tenant).
1. Open your browser and go to the metadata URL.
1. In the browser, look for the 'issuer' object and copy its value. It should look like the following: `https://sts.windows.net/{tenantId}/`.
1. Paste the value for the `ValidTokenIssuerPrefixes` key. You can add multiple by separating them using a comma. An example of this is commented in the sample XML above.

## Step 4. Register the Azure AD account claims provider

### Step 4.1 Make a copy of the user journey

You now need to add the Azure AD identity provider to one of your user journeys. At this point, the identity provider has been set up, but it’s not available in any of the sign-up/sign-in screens.

To make it available, we will create a duplicate of an existing template user journey, and then modify it so that it also has the Azure AD identity provider:

1. Open the base file of your policy (for example, TrustFrameworkBase.xml).
1. Find the `<UserJourneys>` element and copy the entire `<UserJourney>` node that includes `Id="SignUpOrSignIn"`.
1. Open the extension file (for example, TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml) and find the `<UserJourneys>` element. If the element doesn't exist, add one.
1. Paste the entire `<UserJourney>` node that you copied as a child of the `<UserJourneys>` element.
1. Rename the ID of the new user journey (for example, rename as `SignUpOrSignUsingAzureAD`). 

### Step 4.2 Display the "button"

The `<ClaimsProviderSelection>` element is analogous to an identity provider button on a sign-up/sign-in screen. If you add a `<ClaimsProviderSelection>` element for Azure AD, a new button shows up when a user lands on the page. To add this element:

1. Find the `<OrchestrationStep>` node that includes `Order="1"` in the user journey that you created.
1. Add the following:

    ```XML
    <ClaimsProviderSelection TargetClaimsExchangeId="AzureADExchange" />
    ```

1. Set `TargetClaimsExchangeId` to an appropriate value. We recommend following the same convention as others: *\[ClaimProviderName\]Exchange*.

### Step 4.3 Link the button to an action

Now that you have a button in place, you need to link it to an action. The action, in this case, is for Azure AD B2C to communicate with Azure AD to receive a token. Link the button to an action by linking the technical profile for your Azure AD claims provider:

1. Find the `<OrchestrationStep>` that includes `Order="2"` in the `<UserJourney>` node.
1. Add the following:

    ```XML
    <ClaimsExchange Id="AzureADExchange" TechnicalProfileReferenceId="Common-AAD" />
    ```

1. Update `Id` to the same value as that of `TargetClaimsExchangeId` in the preceding section.
1. Update `TechnicalProfileReferenceId` to the ID of the technical profile you created earlier (Common-AAD).

## Step 5: Create a new RP policy

You now need to update the relying party (RP) file that will initiate the user journey that you just created:
 
1. Make a copy of SignUpOrSignIn.xml in your working directory, and rename it (for example, rename it to SignUpOrSignInWithAAD.xml).  
1. Open the new file and update the `PolicyId` attribute for `<TrustFrameworkPolicy>` with a unique value (for example, SignUpOrSignInWithAAD). This will be the name of your policy (for example, B2C\_1A\_SignUpOrSignInWithAAD). 
1. Modify the `ReferenceId` attribute in `<DefaultUserJourney>` to match the ID of the new user journey that you created (SignUpOrSignUsingAzureAD). 
1. Save your changes, and upload the file. 

## Step 6: Upload the policy to your tenant

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), switch to the [context of your Azure AD B2C tenant](active-directory-b2c-navigate-to-b2c-context.md), and then select **Azure AD B2C**.
1. Select **Identity Experience Framework**.
1. Select **All Policies**.
1. Select **Upload Policy**.
1. Select the **Overwrite the policy if it exists** check box.
1. Upload the `TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml` file and the RP file (e.g. `SignUpOrSignInWithAAD.xml`) and ensure they pass validation.

## Step 7: Test the custom policy by using Run Now

1. Select **Azure AD B2C Settings**, and then select **Identity Experience Framework**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Run Now requires at least one application to be preregistered on the tenant. To learn how to register applications, see the Azure AD B2C [Get started](active-directory-b2c-get-started.md) article or the [Application registration](active-directory-b2c-app-registration.md) article.

1. Open the relying party (RP) custom policy that you uploaded (*B2C\_1A\_SignUpOrSignInWithAAD*), and then select **Run now**.
1. You should now be able to sign in by using the Azure AD account.

## (Optional) Step 8: Register the Azure AD account claims provider to the Profile-Edit user journey

You might also want to add the Azure AD account identity provider to your `ProfileEdit` user journey. To make the user journey available, repeat Steps 4 through 6. This time, select the `<UserJourney>` node that contains `Id="ProfileEdit"`. Save, upload, and test your policy.
