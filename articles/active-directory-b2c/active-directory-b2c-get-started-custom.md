# Azure Active Directory B2C: Get started with custom policies

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-advanced-audience-warning](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-advanced-audience-warning.md)]

After you complete the steps in this article, your custom policy will support "local account" sign-up or sign-in via an email address and password. You will also prepare your environment for adding identity providers (like Facebook or Azure Active Directory). We encourage you to complete these steps before reading about other uses of the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2C Identity Experience Framework.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have an Azure AD B2C tenant, which is a container for all your users, apps, policies, and more. If you don't have one already, you need to [create an Azure AD B2C tenant](active-directory-b2c-get-started.md). We strongly encourage all developers to complete the Azure AD B2C built-in policy walkthroughs and configure their applications with built-in policies before proceeding. Your applications will work with both types of policies once you make a minor change to the policy name to invoke the custom policy.

>[!NOTE]
>To access custom policy editing, you need a valid Azure subscription linked to your tenant. If you haven't [linked your Azure AD B2C tenant to an Azure subscription](active-directory-b2c-how-to-enable-billing.md) or your Azure subscription is disabled, the Identity Experience Framework button won't be available.

## Add signing and encryption keys to your B2C tenant for use by custom policies

1. Open the **Identity Experience Framework** blade in your Azure AD B2C tenant settings.
2. Select **Policy Keys** to view the keys available in your tenant.
3. Create B2C_1A_TokenSigningKeyContainer if it does not exist:<br>
    a. Select **Add**. <br>
    b. Select **Generate**.<br>
    c. For **Name**, use `TokenSigningKeyContainer`. <br> 
    The prefix `B2C_1A_` might be added automatically.<br>
    d. For **Key type**, use **RSA**.<br>
    e. For **Dates**, use the defaults. <br>
    f. For **Key usage**, use **Signature**.<br>
    g. Select **Create**.<br>
4. Create B2C_1A_TokenEncryptionKeyContainer if it does not exist:<br>
 a. Select **Add**.<br>
 b. Select **Generate**.<br>
 c. For **Name**, use `TokenEncryptionKeyContainer`. <br>
   The prefix `B2C_1A`_ might be added automatically.<br>
 d. For **Key type**, use **RSA**.<br>
 e. For **Dates**, use the defaults.<br>
 f. For **Key usage**, use **Encryption**.<br>
 g. Select **Create**.<br>
5. Create B2C_1A_FacebookSecret. <br>
If you already have a Facebook application secret, add it as a policy key to your tenant. Otherwise, you must create the key with a placeholder value so that your policies pass validation.<br>
 a. Select **Add**.<br>
 b. For **Options**, use **Manual**.<br>
 c. For **Name**, use `FacebookSecret`. <br>
 The prefix `B2C_1A_` might be added automatically.<br>
 d. In the **Secret** box, enter your FacebookSecret from developers.facebook.com or `0` as a placeholder. *This is not your Facebook app ID.* <br>
 e. For **Key usage**, use **Signature**. <br>
 f. Select **Create** and confirm creation.

## Register Identity Experience Framework applications

Azure AD B2C requires you to register two extra applications that are used by the engine to sign up and sign in users.

>[!NOTE]
>You must create two applications that enable sign-in using local accounts: IdentityExperienceFramework (a web app) and ProxyIdentityExperienceFramework (a native app) with delegated permission from the IdentityExperienceFramework app. Local accounts exist only in your tenant. Your users sign up with a unique email address/password combination to access your tenant-registered applications.

### Create the IdentityExperienceFramework application

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), switch into the [context of your Azure AD B2C tenant](active-directory-b2c-navigate-to-b2c-context.md).
2. Open the **Azure Active Directory** blade (not the **Azure AD B2C** blade). You might need to select **More Services** to find it.
3. Select **App registrations**.
4. Select **New application registration**.
   * For **Name**, use `IdentityExperienceFramework`.
   * For **Application type**, use **Web app/API**.
   * For **Sign-on URL**, use `https://login.microsoftonline.com/yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com`, where `yourtenant` is your Azure AD B2C tenant domain name.
5. Select **Create**.
6. Once it is created, select the newly created application **IdentityExperienceFramework**.<br>
   * Select **Properties**.<br>
   * Copy the application ID and save it for later.

### Create the ProxyIdentityExperienceFramework application

1. Select **App registrations**.
1. Select **New application registration**.
   * For **Name**, use `ProxyIdentityExperienceFramework`.
   * For **Application type**, use **Native**.
   * For **Redirect URI**, use `https://login.microsoftonline.com/yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com`, where `yourtenant` is your Azure AD B2C tenant.
1. Select **Create**.
1. Once it has been created, select the application **ProxyIdentityExperienceFramework**.<br>
   * Select **Properties**. <br>
   * Copy the application ID and save it for later.
1. Select **Required permissions**.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Select **Select an API**.
1. Search for the name IdentityExperienceFramework. Select **IdentityExperienceFramework** in the results, and then click **Select**.
1. Select the check box next to **Access IdentityExperienceFramework**, and then click **Select**.
1. Select **Done**.
1. Select **Grant Permissions**, and then confirm by selecting **Yes**.

## Download starter pack and modify policies

Custom policies are a set of XML files that need to be uploaded to your Azure AD B2C tenant. We provide starter packs to get you going quickly. Each starter pack in the following list contains the smallest number of technical profiles and user journeys needed to achieve the scenarios described:
 * LocalAccounts. Enables the use of local accounts only.
 * SocialAccounts. Enables the use of social (or federated) accounts only.
 * **SocialAndLocalAccounts**. We use this file for the walkthrough.
 * SocialAndLocalAccountsWithMFA. Social, local, and Multi-Factor Authentication options are included here.

Each starter pack contains:

* The [base file](active-directory-b2c-overview-custom.md#policy-files) of the policy. Few modifications are required to the base.
* The [extension file](active-directory-b2c-overview-custom.md#policy-files) of the policy.  This file is where most configuration changes are made.
* [Relying party files](active-directory-b2c-overview-custom.md#policy-files) are task-specific files called by your application.

>[!NOTE]
>If your XML editor supports validation, validate the files against the TrustFrameworkPolicy_0.3.0.0.xsd XML schema that is located in the root directory of the starter pack. XML schema validation identifies errors before uploading.

 Let's get started:

1. Download active-directory-b2c-custom-policy-starterpack from GitHub. [Download the .zip file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-custom-policy-starterpack/archive/master.zip) or run

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-custom-policy-starterpack
    ```
2. Open the SocialAndLocalAccounts folder.  The base file (TrustFrameworkBase.xml) in this folder contains content needed for both local and social/corporate accounts. The social content does not interfere with the steps for getting local accounts up and running.
3. Open TrustFrameworkBase.xml. If you need an XML editor, [try Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), a lightweight cross-platform editor.
4. In the root `TrustFrameworkPolicy` element, update the `TenantId` and `PublicPolicyUri` attributes, replacing `yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com` with the domain name of your Azure AD B2C tenant:
   ```xml
    <TrustFrameworkPolicy
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/online/cpim/schemas/2013/06"
    PolicySchemaVersion="0.3.0.0"
    TenantId="yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com"
    PolicyId="B2C_1A_TrustFrameworkBase"
    PublicPolicyUri="http://yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com">
    ```
   >[!NOTE]
   >`PolicyId` is the policy name that you see in the portal and the name by which this policy file is referenced by other policy files.

5. Save the file.
6. Open TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml. Make the same two changes by replacing `yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com` with your Azure AD B2C tenant. Make the same replacement in the `<TenantId>` element for a total of three changes. Save the file.
7. Open SignUpOrSignIn.xml. Make the same changes by replacing `yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com` with your Azure AD B2C tenant in three places. Save the file.
8. Open the password reset and profile edit files. Make the same changes by replacing `yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com` with your Azure AD B2C tenant in three places in each file. Save the files.

### Add the application IDs to your custom policy
Add the application IDs to the extensions file (`TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml`):

1. In the extensions file (TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml), find the element `<TechnicalProfile Id="login-NonInteractive">`.
2. Replace both instances of `IdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId` with the application ID of the Identity Experience Framework application that you created earlier. Here is an example:

   ```xml
   <Item Key="IdTokenAudience">8322dedc-cbf4-43bc-8bb6-141d16f0f489</Item>
   ```
3. Replace both instances of `ProxyIdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId` with the application ID of the Proxy Identity Experience Framework application that you created earlier.
4. Save your extensions file.

## Upload the policies to your tenant

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), switch into the [context of your Azure AD B2C tenant](active-directory-b2c-navigate-to-b2c-context.md), and open the **Azure AD B2C** blade.
2. Select **Identity Experience Framework**.
3. Select **Upload Policy**.

    >[!WARNING]
    >The custom policy files must be uploaded in the following order:

1. Upload TrustFrameworkBase.xml.
2. Upload TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml.
3. Upload SignUpOrSignin.xml.
4. Upload your other policy files.

When a file is uploaded, the name of the policy file is prepended with `B2C_1A_`.

## Test the custom policy by using Run Now

1. Open **Azure AD B2C Settings** and go to **Identity Experience Framework**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >**Run now** requires at least one application to be preregistered on the tenant. Applications must be registered in the B2C tenant, either by using the **Applications** menu selection in Azure AD B2C or by using the Identity Experience Framework to invoke both built-in and custom policies. Only one registration per application is needed.<br><br>
   To learn how to register applications, see the Azure AD B2C [Get started](active-directory-b2c-get-started.md) article or the [Application registration](active-directory-b2c-app-registration.md) article.  

2. Open B2C_1A_signup_signin, the relying party (RP) custom policy that you uploaded. Select **Run now**.

3. You should be able to sign up using an email address.

4. Sign in with the same account to confirm that you have the correct configuration.

>[!NOTE]
>A common cause of sign-in failure is an improperly configured IdentityExperienceFramework app.


## Next steps

### Add Facebook as an identity provider
To set up Facebook:
1. [Configure a Facebook application in developers.facebook.com](active-directory-b2c-setup-fb-app.md).
2. [Add the Facebook application secret to your Azure AD B2C tenant](#add-signing-and-encryption-keys-to-your-b2c-tenant-for-use-by-custom-policies).
3. In the TrustFrameworkExtensions policy file, replace the value of `client_id` with the Facebook application ID:

   ```xml
   <TechnicalProfile Id="Facebook-OAUTH">
     <Metadata>
     <!--Replace the value of client_id in this technical profile with the Facebook app ID"-->
       <Item Key="client_id">00000000000000</Item>
   ```
4. Upload the TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml policy file to your tenant.
5. Test by using **Run now** or by invoking the policy directly from your registered application.

### Add Azure Active Directory as an identity provider
The base file used in this getting started guide already contains some of the content that you need for adding other identity providers. For information on setting up sign-ins, see the [Azure Active Directory B2C: Sign in by using Azure AD accounts](active-directory-b2c-setup-aad-custom.md) article.

For an overview of custom policies in Azure AD B2C that use the Identity Experience Framework, see the [Azure Active Directory B2C: Custom policies](active-directory-b2c-overview-custom.md) article.
