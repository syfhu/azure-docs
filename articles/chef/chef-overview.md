# Using Chef with Azure
[Chef](http://www.chef.io) is a powerful automation platform that transforms virtual machine infrastructure on Azure into code. Chef automates how infrastructure is configured, deployed, and managed across your network, no matter its size.

This article describes the benefits of using Chef to manage Azure infrastructure.

## Automate infrastructure, apps, and compliance with one platform
Companies require speed, velocity, and safety to compete in the digital marketplace. Together Chef and Microsoft help individuals, teams, and enterprises accomplish all of these things. With one platform, Chef Automate, you can now automate and continuously deliver your infrastructure, applications, and even compliance across your Microsoft estate.
