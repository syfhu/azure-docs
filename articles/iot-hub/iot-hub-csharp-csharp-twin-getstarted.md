# Get started with device twins (.NET/.NET)
[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-twin-get-started](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-twin-get-started.md)]

At the end of this tutorial, you will have these .NET console apps:

* **CreateDeviceIdentity**, a .NET app which creates a device identity and associated security key to connect your simulated device app.
* **AddTagsAndQuery**, a .NET back-end app which adds tags and queries device twins.
* **ReportConnectivity**, a .NET device app which simulates a device that connects to your IoT hub with the device identity created earlier, and reports its connectivity condition.

> [!NOTE]
> The article [Azure IoT SDKs][lnk-hub-sdks] provides information about the Azure IoT SDKs that you can use to build both device and back-end apps.
> 
> 

To complete this tutorial you need the following:

* Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio 2017.
* An active Azure account. (If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account][lnk-free-trial] in just a couple of minutes.)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-get-started-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-get-started-create-hub.md)]

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-get-started-create-device-identity-portal](../../includes/iot-hub-get-started-create-device-identity-portal.md)]

## Create the service app
In this section, you create a .NET console app (using C#) that adds location metadata to the device twin associated with **myDeviceId**. It then queries the device twins stored in the IoT hub selecting the devices located in the US, and then the ones that reported a cellular connection.

1. In Visual Studio, add a Visual C# Windows Classic Desktop project to the current solution by using the **Console Application** project template. Name the project **AddTagsAndQuery**.
   
    ![New Visual C# Windows Classic Desktop project][img-createapp]
1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **AddTagsAndQuery** project, and then click **Manage NuGet Packages...**.
1. In the **NuGet Package Manager** window, select **Browse** and search for **microsoft.azure.devices**. Select **Install** to install the **Microsoft.Azure.Devices** package, and accept the terms of use. This procedure downloads, installs, and adds a reference to the [Azure IoT service SDK][lnk-nuget-service-sdk] NuGet package and its dependencies.
   
    ![NuGet Package Manager window][img-servicenuget]
1. Add the following `using` statements at the top of the **Program.cs** file:
   
        using Microsoft.Azure.Devices;
1. Add the following fields to the **Program** class. Replace the placeholder value with the IoT Hub connection string for the hub that you created in the previous section.
   
        static RegistryManager registryManager;
        static string connectionString = "{iot hub connection string}";
1. Add the following method to the **Program** class:
   
        public static async Task AddTagsAndQuery()
        {
            var twin = await registryManager.GetTwinAsync("myDeviceId");
            var patch =
                @"{
                    tags: {
                        location: {
                            region: 'US',
                            plant: 'Redmond43'
                        }
                    }
                }";
            await registryManager.UpdateTwinAsync(twin.DeviceId, patch, twin.ETag);
   
            var query = registryManager.CreateQuery("SELECT * FROM devices WHERE tags.location.plant = 'Redmond43'", 100);
            var twinsInRedmond43 = await query.GetNextAsTwinAsync();
            Console.WriteLine("Devices in Redmond43: {0}", string.Join(", ", twinsInRedmond43.Select(t => t.DeviceId)));
   
            query = registryManager.CreateQuery("SELECT * FROM devices WHERE tags.location.plant = 'Redmond43' AND properties.reported.connectivity.type = 'cellular'", 100);
            var twinsInRedmond43UsingCellular = await query.GetNextAsTwinAsync();
            Console.WriteLine("Devices in Redmond43 using cellular network: {0}", string.Join(", ", twinsInRedmond43UsingCellular.Select(t => t.DeviceId)));
        }
   
    The **RegistryManager** class exposes all the methods required to interact with device twins from the service. The previous code first initializes the **registryManager** object, then retrieves the device twin for **myDeviceId**, and finally updates its tags with the desired location information.
   
    After updating, it executes two queries: the first selects only the device twins of devices located in the **Redmond43** plant, and the second refines the query to select only the devices that are also connected through cellular network.
   
    Note that the previous code, when it creates the **query** object, specifies a maximum number of returned documents. The **query** object contains a **HasMoreResults** boolean property that you can use to invoke the **GetNextAsTwinAsync** methods multiple times to retrieve all results. A method called **GetNextAsJson** is available for results that are not device twins, for example, results of aggregation queries.
1. Finally, add the following lines to the **Main** method:
   
        registryManager = RegistryManager.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString);
        AddTagsAndQuery().Wait();
        Console.WriteLine("Press Enter to exit.");
        Console.ReadLine();

1. In the Solution Explorer, open the **Set StartUp projects...** and make sure the **Action** for **AddTagsAndQuery** project is **Start**. Build the solution.
1. Run this application by right-clicking on the **AddTagsAndQuery** project and selecting **Debug**, followed by **Start new instance**. You should see one device in the results for the query asking for all devices located in **Redmond43** and none for the query that restricts the results to devices that use a cellular network.
   
    ![Query results in window][img-addtagapp]

In the next section, you create a device app that reports the connectivity information and changes the result of the query in the previous section.

## Create the device app
In this section, you create a .NET console app that connects to your hub as **myDeviceId**, and then updates its reported properties to contain the information that it is connected using a cellular network.

1. In Visual Studio, add a Visual C# Windows Classic Desktop project to the current solution by using the **Console Application** project template. Name the project **ReportConnectivity**.
   
    ![New Visual C# Windows Classic device app][img-createdeviceapp]
    
1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **ReportConnectivity** project, and then click **Manage NuGet Packages...**.
1. In the **NuGet Package Manager** window, select **Browse** and search for **microsoft.azure.devices.client**. Select **Install** to install the **Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client** package, and accept the terms of use. This procedure downloads, installs, and adds a reference to the [Azure IoT device SDK][lnk-nuget-client-sdk] NuGet package and its dependencies.
   
    ![NuGet Package Manager window Client app][img-clientnuget]
1. Add the following `using` statements at the top of the **Program.cs** file:
   
        using Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client;
        using Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Shared;
        using Newtonsoft.Json;

1. Add the following fields to the **Program** class. Replace the placeholder value with the device connection string that you noted in the previous section.
   
        static string DeviceConnectionString = "HostName=<yourIotHubName>.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=<yourIotDeviceName>;SharedAccessKey=<yourIotDeviceAccessKey>";
        static DeviceClient Client = null;

1. Add the following method to the **Program** class:

       public static async void InitClient()
        {
            try
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Connecting to hub");
                Client = DeviceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(DeviceConnectionString, TransportType.Mqtt);
                Console.WriteLine("Retrieving twin");
                await Client.GetTwinAsync();
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine();
                Console.WriteLine("Error in sample: {0}", ex.Message);
            }
        }

    The **Client** object exposes all the methods you require to interact with device twins from the device. The code shown above, initializes the **Client** object, and then retrieves the device twin for **myDeviceId**.

1. Add the following method to the **Program** class:
   
        public static async void ReportConnectivity()
        {
            try
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Sending connectivity data as reported property");
                
                TwinCollection reportedProperties, connectivity;
                reportedProperties = new TwinCollection();
                connectivity = new TwinCollection();
                connectivity["type"] = "cellular";
                reportedProperties["connectivity"] = connectivity;
                await Client.UpdateReportedPropertiesAsync(reportedProperties);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine();
                Console.WriteLine("Error in sample: {0}", ex.Message);
            }
        }

   The code above updates **myDeviceId**'s reported property with the connectivity information.

1. Finally, add the following lines to the **Main** method:
   
       try
       {
            InitClient();
            ReportConnectivity();
       }
       catch (Exception ex)
       {
            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine("Error in sample: {0}", ex.Message);
       }
       Console.WriteLine("Press Enter to exit.");
       Console.ReadLine();

1. In the Solution Explorer, open the **Set StartUp projects...** and make sure the **Action** for **ReportConnectivity** project is **Start**. Build the solution.
1. Run this application by right-clicking on the **ReportConnectivity** project and selecting **Debug**, followed by **Start new instance**. You should see it getting the twin information, and then sending connectivity as a *reported property*.
   
    ![Run device app to report connectivity][img-rundeviceapp]
    
    
1. Now that the device reported its connectivity information, it should appear in both queries. Run the .NET **AddTagsAndQuery** app to run the queries again. This time **myDeviceId** should appear in both query results.
   
    ![Device connectivity reported successfully][img-tagappsuccess]

## Next steps
In this tutorial, you configured a new IoT hub in the Azure portal, and then created a device identity in the IoT hub's identity registry. You added device metadata as tags from a back-end app, and wrote a simulated device app to report device connectivity information in the device twin. You also learned how to query this information using the SQL-like IoT Hub query language.

Use the following resources to learn how to:

* send telemetry from devices with the [Get started with IoT Hub][lnk-iothub-getstarted] tutorial,
* configure devices using device twin's desired properties with the [Use desired properties to configure devices][lnk-twin-how-to-configure] tutorial,
* control devices interactively (such as turning on a fan from a user-controlled app) with the [Use direct methods][lnk-methods-tutorial] tutorial.
