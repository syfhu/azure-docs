# Send device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub

To send time-series telemetry and alerts from your devices to your solution back end, send device-to-cloud messages from your device to your IoT hub. For a discussion of other device-to-cloud options supported by IoT Hub, see [Device-to-cloud communications guidance][lnk-d2c-guidance].

You send device-to-cloud messages through a device-facing endpoint (**/devices/{deviceId}/messages/events**). Routing rules then route your messages to one of the service-facing endpoints on your IoT hub. Routing rules use the headers and body of the device-to-cloud messages to determine where to route them. By default, messages are routed to the built-in service-facing endpoint (**messages/events**), that is compatible with [Event Hubs][lnk-event-hubs]. Therefore, you can use standard [Event Hubs integration and SDKs][lnk-compatible-endpoint] to receive device-to-cloud messages in your solution back end.

IoT Hub implements device-to-cloud messaging using a streaming messaging pattern. IoT Hub's device-to-cloud messages are more like [Event Hubs][lnk-event-hubs] *events* than [Service Bus][lnk-servicebus] *messages* in that there is a high volume of events passing through the service that can be read by multiple readers.

Device-to-cloud messaging with IoT Hub has the following characteristics:

* Device-to-cloud messages are durable and retained in an IoT hub's default **messages/events** endpoint for up to seven days.
* Device-to-cloud messages can be at most 256 KB, and can be grouped in batches to optimize sends. Batches can be at most 256 KB.
* As explained in the [Control access to IoT Hub][lnk-devguide-security] section, IoT Hub enables per-device authentication and access control.
* IoT Hub allows you to create up to 10 custom endpoints. Messages are delivered to the endpoints based on routes configured on your IoT hub. For more information, see [Routing rules](iot-hub-devguide-query-language.md#device-to-cloud-message-routes-query-expressions).
* IoT Hub enables millions of simultaneously connected devices (see [Quotas and throttling][lnk-quotas]).
* IoT Hub does not allow arbitrary partitioning. Device-to-cloud messages are partitioned based on their originating **deviceId**.

For more information about the differences between IoT Hub and Event Hubs, see [Comparison of Azure IoT Hub and Azure Event Hubs][lnk-comparison].

## Send non-telemetry traffic

Often, in addition to telemetry, devices send messages and requests that require separate execution and handling in the solution back end. For example, critical alerts that must trigger a specific action in the back end. You can write a [routing rule][lnk-devguide-custom] to send these types of messages to an endpoint dedicated to their processing based on either a header on the message or a value in the message body.

For more information about the best way to process this kind of message, see the [Tutorial: How to process IoT Hub device-to-cloud messages][lnk-d2c-tutorial] tutorial.

## Route device-to-cloud messages

You have two options for routing device-to-cloud messages to your back-end apps:

* Use the built-in [Event Hub-compatible endpoint][lnk-compatible-endpoint] to enable back-end apps to read the device-to-cloud messages received by the hub. To learn about the built-in Event Hub-compatible endpoint, see [Read device-to-cloud messages from the built-in endpoint][lnk-devguide-builtin].
* Use routing rules to send messages to custom endpoints in your IoT hub. Custom endpoints enable your back-end apps to read device-to-cloud messages using Event Hubs, Service Bus queues, or Service Bus topics. To learn about routing and custom endpoints, see [Use custom endpoints and routing rules for device-to-cloud messages][lnk-devguide-custom].

## Anti-spoofing properties

To avoid device spoofing in device-to-cloud messages, IoT Hub stamps all messages with the following properties:

* **ConnectionDeviceId**
* **ConnectionDeviceGenerationId**
* **ConnectionAuthMethod**

The first two contain the **deviceId** and **generationId** of the originating device, as per [Device identity properties][lnk-device-properties].

The **ConnectionAuthMethod** property contains a JSON serialized object, with the following properties:

```json
{
  "scope": "{ hub | device }",
  "type": "{ symkey | sas | x509 }",
  "issuer": "iothub"
}
```

## Next steps

For information about the SDKs you can use to send device-to-cloud messages, see [Azure IoT SDKs][lnk-sdks].

The [Get Started][lnk-get-started] tutorials show you how to send device-to-cloud messages from both simulated and physical devices. For more detail, see the [Process IoT Hub device-to-cloud messages using routes][lnk-d2c-tutorial] tutorial.
