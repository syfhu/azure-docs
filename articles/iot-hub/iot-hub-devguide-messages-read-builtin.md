# Read device-to-cloud messages from the built-in endpoint

By default, messages are routed to the built-in service-facing endpoint (**messages/events**) that is compatible with [Event Hubs][lnk-event-hubs]. This endpoint is currently only exposed using the [AMQP][lnk-amqp] protocol on port 5671. An IoT hub exposes the following properties to enable you to control the built-in Event Hub-compatible messaging endpoint **messages/events**.

| Property            | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| **Partition count** | Set this property at creation to define the number of [partitions][lnk-event-hub-partitions] for device-to-cloud event ingestion. |
| **Retention time**  | This property specifies how long in days messages are retained by IoT Hub. The default is one day, but it can be increased to seven days. |

IoT Hub also enables you to manage consumer groups on the built-in device-to-cloud receive endpoint.

By default, all messages that do not explicitly match a message routing rule are written to the built-in endpoint. If you disable this fallback route, messages that do not explicitly match any message routing rules are dropped.

You can modify the retention time, either programmatically using the [IoT Hub resource provider REST APIs][lnk-resource-provider-apis], or with the [Azure portal][lnk-management-portal].

IoT Hub exposes the **messages/events** built-in endpoint for your back-end services to read the device-to-cloud messages received by your hub. This endpoint is Event Hub-compatible, which enables you to use any of the mechanisms the Event Hubs service supports for reading messages.

## Read from the built-in endpoint

When you use the [Azure Service Bus SDK for .NET][lnk-servicebus-sdk] or the [Event Hubs - Event Processor Host][lnk-eventprocessorhost], you can use any IoT Hub connection strings with the correct permissions. Then use **messages/events** as the Event Hub name.

When you use SDKs (or product integrations) that are unaware of IoT Hub, you must retrieve an Event Hub-compatible endpoint and Event Hub-compatible name:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal][lnk-management-portal] and navigate to your IoT hub.
1. Click **Endpoints**.
1. In the **Built-in endpoints** section, click **Events**. 
1. A properties page opens, which contains the following values: **Event Hub-compatible endpoint**, **Event Hub-compatible name**, **Partitions**, **Retention time**, and **Consumer groups**.

    ![Device-to-cloud settings][img-eventhubcompatible]

The IoT Hub SDK requires the IoT Hub endpoint name, which is **messages/events** as shown under **Endpoints**.

If the SDK you are using requires a **Hostname** or **Namespace** value, remove the scheme from the **Event Hub-compatible endpoint**. For example, if your Event Hub-compatible endpoint is **sb://iothub-ns-myiothub-1234.servicebus.windows.net/**, the **Hostname** would be **iothub-ns-myiothub-1234.servicebus.windows.net**. The **Namespace** would be **iothub-ns-myiothub-1234**.

You can then use any shared access policy that has the **ServiceConnect** permissions to connect to the specified Event Hub.

If you need to build an Event Hub connection string by using the previous information, use the following pattern:

`Endpoint={Event Hub-compatible endpoint};SharedAccessKeyName={iot hub policy name};SharedAccessKey={iot hub policy key}`

The SDKs and integrations that you can use with Event Hub-compatible endpoints that IoT Hub exposes includes the items in the following list:

* [Java Event Hubs client](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-java).
* [Apache Storm spout](../hdinsight/storm/apache-storm-develop-csharp-event-hub-topology.md). You can view the [spout source](https://github.com/apache/storm/tree/master/external/storm-eventhubs) on GitHub.
* [Apache Spark integration](../hdinsight/spark/apache-spark-eventhub-streaming.md).

## Next steps

For more information about IoT Hub endpoints, see [IoT Hub endpoints][lnk-endpoints].

The [Get Started][lnk-get-started] tutorials show you how to send device-to-cloud messages from simulated devices and read the messages from the built-in endpoint. For more detail, see the [Process IoT Hub device-to-cloud messages using routes][lnk-d2c-tutorial] tutorial.

If you want to route your device-to-cloud messages to custom endpoints, see [Use message routes and custom endpoints for device-to-cloud messages][lnk-custom].
