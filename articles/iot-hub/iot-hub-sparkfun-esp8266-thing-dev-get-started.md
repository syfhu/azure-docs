![connection between DHT22, Thing Dev, and IoT Hub](media/iot-hub-sparkfun-thing-dev-get-started/1_connection-hdt22-thing-dev-iot-hub.png)

## What you will do

Connect Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing Dev to an IoT hub you will create. Then run a sample application on ESP8266 to collect temperature and humidity data from a DHT22 sensor. Finally, send the sensor data to your IoT hub.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using other ESP8266 boards, you can still follow these steps to connect it to your IoT hub. Depending on the ESP8266 board you are using, you may need to reconfigure the `LED_PIN`. For example, if you are using ESP8266 from AI-Thinker, you may change it from `0` to `2`. Don't have a kit yet?: Click [here](http://azure.com/iotstarterkits)

## Connect ESP8266 Thing Dev with the sensor and your computer

### Connect a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor to ESP8266 Thing Dev

Use the breadboard and jumper wires to make the connection as follows. If you don’t have a sensor, skip this section because you can use simulated sensor data instead.

![connections reference](media/iot-hub-sparkfun-thing-dev-get-started/15_connections_on_breadboard.png)

For sensor pins, we will use the following wiring:

| Start (Sensor)           | End (Board)           | Cable Color   |
| -----------------------  | ---------------------- | ------------: |
| VDD (Pin 27F)            | 3V (Pin 8A)           | Red cable     |
| DATA (Pin 28F)           | GPIO 2 (Pin 9A)       | White cable    |
| GND (Pin 30F)            | GND (Pin 7J)          | Black cable   |

### Add serial port permissions – Ubuntu only

If you use Ubuntu, make sure a normal user has the permissions to operate on the USB port of Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing Dev. To add serial port permissions for a normal user, follow these steps:

1. Run the following commands at a terminal:

   ```bash
   ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*
   ls -l /dev/ttyACM*
   ```

   You get one of the following outputs:

   * crw-rw---- 1 root uucp xxxxxxxx
   * crw-rw---- 1 root dialout xxxxxxxx

   In the output, notice `uucp` or `dialout` that is the group owner name of the USB port.

1. Add the user to the group by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -a -G <group-owner-name> <username>
   ```

   `<group-owner-name>` is the group owner name you obtained in the previous step. `<username>` is your Ubuntu user name.

1. Log out Ubuntu and log in it again for the change to take effect.

## Collect sensor data and send it to your IoT hub

In this section, you deploy and run a sample application on Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing Dev. The sample application blinks the LED on Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing Dev and sends the temperature and humidity data collected from the DHT22 sensor to your IoT hub.

### Get the sample application from GitHub

The sample application is hosted on GitHub. Clone the sample repository that contains the sample application from GitHub. To clone the sample repository, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt or a terminal window.
