In this tutorial, you begin by learning the basics of working with your Arduino board. You then learn how to seamlessly connect your devices to the cloud by using [Azure IoT Hub](iot-hub-what-is-iot-hub.md).

## What you do

Connect Adafruit Feather M0 WiFi to an IoT hub that you create. Then you run a sample application on M0 WiFi to collect the temperature and humidity data from a BME280. Finally, you send the sensor data to your IoT hub.


## What you learn

* How to create an IoT hub and register a device for Feather M0 WiFi
* How to connect Feather M0 WiFi with the sensor and your computer
* How to collect sensor data by running a sample application on Feather M0 WiFi
* How to send the sensor data to your IoT hub

## What you need

![Parts needed for the tutorial](media/iot-hub-adafruit-feather-m0-wifi-get-started/2_parts-needed-for-the-tutorial.png)

To complete this operation, you need the following parts from your Feather M0 WiFi Starter Kit:

* The Feather M0 WiFi board
* A Micro USB to Type A USB cable

You also need the following things for your development environment:

* An active Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure account, [create a free Azure trial account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) in just a few minutes.
* A Mac or PC that is running Windows or Ubuntu.
* A wireless network for Feather M0 WiFi to connect to.
* An Internet connection to download the configuration tool.
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) version 1.6.8 or later. Earlier versions don't work with the Azure IoT Hub library.

If you don’t have a sensor, the following items are optional. You also have the option of using simulated sensor data:

* A BME280 temperature and humidity sensor
* A breadboard
* M/M jumper wires

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-get-started-create-hub-and-device](../../includes/iot-hub-get-started-create-hub-and-device.md)]

## Connect Feather M0 WiFi with the sensor and your computer
In this section, you connect the sensors to your board. Then you plug in your device to your computer for further use.

### Connect a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor to Feather M0 WiFi

Use the breadboard and jumper wires to make the connection. If you don’t have a sensor, skip this section because you can use simulated sensor data instead.

### Add serial port permissions (Ubuntu only)

If you use Ubuntu, make sure you have the permissions to operate on the USB port of Feather M0 WiFi. To add serial port permissions, follow these steps:


1. At a terminal, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*
   ls -l /dev/ttyACM*
   ```

   You get one of the following outputs:

   * crw-rw---- 1 root uucp xxxxxxxx
   * crw-rw---- 1 root dialout xxxxxxxx

   In the output, notice that `uucp` or `dialout` is the group owner name of the USB port.

2. To add the user to the group, run the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -a -G <group-owner-name> <username>
   ```

   In the previous step, you obtained the group owner name `<group-owner-name>`. Your Ubuntu user name is `<username>`.

3. For the change to appear, sign out of Ubuntu and then sign in again.

## Collect sensor data and send it to your IoT hub

In this section, you deploy and run a sample application on Feather M0 WiFi. The sample application makes the LED blink on Feather M0 WiFi. It then sends the temperature and humidity data collected from the BME280 sensor to your IoT hub.
