# Use device management to initiate a device firmware update (Python/Python)
[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-firmware-update](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-firmware-update.md)]

In the [Get started with device management][lnk-dm-getstarted] tutorial, you saw how to use the [device twin][lnk-devtwin] and [direct methods][lnk-c2dmethod] primitives to remotely reboot a device. This tutorial uses the same IoT Hub primitives and provides guidance and shows you how to do an end-to-end simulated firmware update.  This pattern is used in the firmware update implementation for the Intel Edison device sample.

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-basic](../../includes/iot-hub-basic-whole.md)]

This tutorial shows you how to:

* Create a Python console app that calls the firmwareUpdate direct method in the simulated device app through your IoT hub.
* Create a simulated device app that implements a **firmwareUpdate** direct method. This method initiates a multi-stage process that waits to download the firmware image, downloads the firmware image, and finally applies the firmware image. During each stage of the update, the device uses the reported properties to report on progress.

At the end of this tutorial, you have two Python console apps:

**dmpatterns_fwupdate_service.py**, which calls a direct method in the simulated device app, displays the response, and periodically (every 500ms) displays the updated reported properties.

**dmpatterns_fwupdate_device.py**, which connects to your IoT hub with the device identity created earlier, receives a firmwareUpdate direct method, runs through a multi-state process to simulate a firmware update including: waiting for the image download, downloading the new image, and finally applying the image.

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* [Python 2.x or 3.x][lnk-python-download]. Make sure to use the 32-bit or 64-bit installation as required by your setup. When prompted during the installation, make sure to add Python to your platform-specific environment variable. If you are using Python 2.x, you may need to [install or upgrade *pip*, the Python package management system][lnk-install-pip].
* If you are using Windows OS, then [Visual C++ redistributable package][lnk-visual-c-redist] to allow the use of native DLLs from Python.
* An active Azure account. (If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account][lnk-free-trial] in just a couple of minutes.)

## Trigger a remote firmware update on the device using a direct method
In this section, you create a Python console app that initiates a remote firmware update on a device. The app uses a direct method to initiate the update and uses device twin queries to periodically get the status of the active firmware update.

1. At your command prompt, run the following command to install the **azure-iothub-service-client** package:
   
    ```cmd/sh
    pip install azure-iothub-service-client
    ```

1. Using a text editor, in your working directory, create a **dmpatterns_getstarted_service.py** file.

1. Add the following 'import' statements and variables at the start of the **dmpatterns_getstarted_service.py** file. Replace `IoTHubConnectionString` and `deviceId` with your values noted previously:
   
    ```python
    import sys
    import time

    import iothub_service_client
    from iothub_service_client import IoTHubDeviceTwin, IoTHubDeviceMethod, IoTHubError

    CONNECTION_STRING = "{IoTHubConnectionString}"
    DEVICE_ID = "{deviceId}"

    METHOD_NAME = "firmwareUpdate"
    METHOD_PAYLOAD = "{\"fwPackageUri\":\"test.com\"}"
    TIMEOUT = 60
    MESSAGE_COUNT = 5
    ```

1. Add the following function to call the direct method and display the value of the firmwareUpdate reported property. Also add the `main` routine:
   
    ```python
    def iothub_firmware_sample_run():
        try:
            iothub_twin_method = IoTHubDeviceTwin(CONNECTION_STRING)

            print ( "" )
            print ( "Direct Method called." )
            iothub_device_method = IoTHubDeviceMethod(CONNECTION_STRING)
		
            response = iothub_device_method.invoke(DEVICE_ID, METHOD_NAME, METHOD_PAYLOAD, TIMEOUT)
            print ( response.payload )
		
            print ( "" )
            print ( "Device Twin queried, press Ctrl-C to exit" )
            while True:
                twin_info = iothub_twin_method.get_twin(DEVICE_ID)

                if "\"firmwareStatus\":\"standBy\"" in twin_info:
                    print ( "Waiting on device..." )
                elif "\"firmwareStatus\":\"downloading\"" in twin_info:
                    print ( "Downloading firmware..." )
                elif "\"firmwareStatus\":\"applying\"" in twin_info:
                    print ( "Download complete, applying firmware..." )
                elif "\"firmwareStatus\":\"completed\"" in twin_info:
                    print ( "Firmware applied" )
                    print ( "" )
                    print ( "Get reported properties from device twin:" )
                    print ( twin_info )
                    break
                else:
                    print ( "Unknown status" )

                status_counter = 0
                while status_counter <= MESSAGE_COUNT:
                    time.sleep(1)
                    status_counter += 1

        except IoTHubError as iothub_error:
            print ( "" )
            print ( "Unexpected error {0}" % iothub_error )
            return
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print ( "" )
            print ( "IoTHubService sample stopped" )

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print ( "Starting the IoT Hub firmware update Python sample..." )
        print ( "    Connection string = {0}".format(CONNECTION_STRING) )
        print ( "    Device ID         = {0}".format(DEVICE_ID) )

        iothub_firmware_sample_run()
    ```

1. Save and close the **dmpatterns_fwupdate_service.py** file.


## Create a simulated device app
In this section, you:

* Create a Python console app that responds to a direct method called by the cloud
* Trigger a simulated firmware update
* Use the reported properties to enable device twin queries to identify devices and when they last completed a firmware update

1. At your command prompt, run the following command to install the **azure-iothub-device-client** package:
   
    ```cmd/sh
    pip install azure-iothub-device-client
    ```

1. Using a text editor, create a **dmpatterns_fwupdate_device.py** file.

1. Add the following 'import' statements and variables at the start of the **dmpatterns_fwupdate_device.py** file. Replace `deviceConnectionString` with the device connection string from your IoT hub:
   
    ```python
    import time, datetime
    import sys
    import threading

    import iothub_client
    from iothub_client import IoTHubClient, IoTHubClientError, IoTHubTransportProvider, IoTHubClientResult
    from iothub_client import IoTHubError, DeviceMethodReturnValue

    SEND_REPORTED_STATE_CONTEXT = 0
    METHOD_CONTEXT = 0

    MESSAGE_COUNT = 10

    PROTOCOL = IoTHubTransportProvider.MQTT
    CONNECTION_STRING = "{deviceConnectionString}"
    CLIENT = IoTHubClient(CONNECTION_STRING, PROTOCOL)
    ```

1. Add the following functions that are used to provide reported properties updates and implement the direct method:
   
    ```python
    def send_reported_state_callback(status_code, user_context):
        print ( "Reported state updated." )

    def device_method_callback(method_name, payload, user_context):
        if method_name == "firmwareUpdate":
            print ( "Starting firmware update." )
            image_url = payload
            thr = threading.Thread(target=simulate_download_image, args=([payload]), kwargs={})
            thr.start()
    
            device_method_return_value = DeviceMethodReturnValue()
            device_method_return_value.response = "{ \"Response\": \"Firmware update started\" }"
            device_method_return_value.status = 200
            return device_method_return_value
    ```

1. Add the following functions that simulate downloading and applying the firmware image:
   
    ```python
    def simulate_download_image(image_url):
        time.sleep(15)
        print ( "Downloading image from: " + image_url )

        reported_state = "{\"firmwareStatus\":\"downloading\", \"downloadComplete\":\"" + str(datetime.datetime.now()) + "\"}"
        CLIENT.send_reported_state(reported_state, len(reported_state), send_reported_state_callback, SEND_REPORTED_STATE_CONTEXT)
        time.sleep(15)
	
        simulate_apply_image(image_url)
	
    def simulate_apply_image(image_url):
        print ( "Applying image from: " + image_url )

        reported_state = "{\"firmwareStatus\":\"applying\", \"startedApplyingImage\":\"" + str(datetime.datetime.now()) + "\"}"
        CLIENT.send_reported_state(reported_state, len(reported_state), send_reported_state_callback, SEND_REPORTED_STATE_CONTEXT)
        time.sleep(15)
	
        simulate_complete_image()

    def simulate_complete_image():
        print ( "Image applied." )

        reported_state = "{\"firmwareStatus\":\"completed\", \"lastFirmwareUpdate\":\"" + str(datetime.datetime.now()) + "\"}"
        CLIENT.send_reported_state(reported_state, len(reported_state), send_reported_state_callback, SEND_REPORTED_STATE_CONTEXT)
    ```

8. Add the following function that initializes the device twin's reported properties and wait for the direct method to be called. Also add the `main` routine:
   
    ```python
    def iothub_firmware_sample_run():
        try:
            CLIENT.set_device_method_callback(device_method_callback, METHOD_CONTEXT)

            reported_state = "{\"firmwareStatus\":\"standBy\", \"logTime\":\"" + str(datetime.datetime.now()) + "\"}"
            CLIENT.send_reported_state(reported_state, len(reported_state), send_reported_state_callback, SEND_REPORTED_STATE_CONTEXT)
            print ( "Device twins initialized." )
            print ( "IoTHubClient waiting for commands, press Ctrl-C to exit" )
		
            while True:
                status_counter = 0
                while status_counter <= MESSAGE_COUNT:
                    time.sleep(10)
                    status_counter += 1
            
        except IoTHubError as iothub_error:
            print ( "Unexpected error %s from IoTHub" % iothub_error )
            return
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print ( "IoTHubClient sample stopped" )

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print ( "Starting the IoT Hub Python firmware update sample..." )
        print ( "    Protocol %s" % PROTOCOL )
        print ( "    Connection string=%s" % CONNECTION_STRING )

        iothub_firmware_sample_run()
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> To keep things simple, this tutorial does not implement any retry policy. In production code, you should implement retry policies (such as an exponential backoff), as suggested in the MSDN article [Transient Fault Handling](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh675232.aspx).

## Run the apps
You are now ready to run the apps.

1. At the command prompt, run the following command to begin listening for the reboot direct method.
   
    ```cmd/sh
    python dmpatterns_fwupdate_device.py
    ```

1. At another command prompt, run the following command to trigger the remote reboot and query for the device twin to find the last reboot time.
   
    ```cmd/sh
    python dmpatterns_fwupdate_service.py
    ```

1. You see the device response to the direct method in the console. Then note the change in reported properties throughout the firmware update.

## Next steps
In this tutorial, you used a direct method to trigger a remote firmware update on a device and used the reported properties to follow the progress of the firmware update.
