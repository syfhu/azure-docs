# As a developer new to IoT Hub, I need to see how IoT Hub sends telemetry from a device to an IoT hub and how to read that telemetry data from the hub using a back-end application.

# Quickstart: Send telemetry from a device to an IoT hub and read the telemetry from the hub with a back-end application (Node.js)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-quickstarts-1-selector](../../includes/iot-hub-quickstarts-1-selector.md)]

IoT Hub is an Azure service that enables you to ingest high volumes of telemetry from your IoT devices into the cloud for storage or processing. In this quickstart, you send telemetry from a simulated device application, through IoT Hub, to a back-end application for processing.

The quickstart uses two pre-written Node.js applications, one to send the telemetry and one to read the telemetry from the hub. Before you run these two applications, you create an IoT hub and register a device with the hub.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

The two sample applications you run in this quickstart are written using Node.js. You need Node.js v4.x.x or later on your development machine.

You can download Node.js for multiple platforms from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

You can verify the current version of Node.js on your development machine using the following command:

```cmd/sh
node --version
```

Download the sample Node.js project from https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-iot-samples-node/archive/master.zip and extract the ZIP archive.

## Create an IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-quickstarts-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-quickstarts-create-hub.md)]

## Register a device

A device must be registered with your IoT hub before it can connect. In this quickstart, you use the Azure CLI to register a simulated device.

1. Add the IoT Hub CLI extension and create the device identity. Replace `{YourIoTHubName}` with the name you chose for your IoT hub:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az extension add --name azure-cli-iot-ext
    az iot hub device-identity create --hub-name {YourIoTHubName} --device-id MyNodeDevice
    ```

    If you choose a different name for your device, update the device name in the sample applications before you run them.

1. Run the following command to get the _device connection string_ for the device you just registered:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub device-identity show-connection-string --hub-name {YourIoTHubName} --device-id MyNodeDevice --output table
    ```

    Make a note of the device connection string, which looks like `Hostname=...=`. You use this value later in the quickstart.

1. You also need a _service connection string_ to enable the back-end application to connect to your IoT hub and retrieve the messages. The following command retrieves the service connection string for your IoT hub:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub show-connection-string --hub-name {YourIoTHubName} --output table
    ```

    Make a note of the service connection string, which looks like `Hostname=...=`. You use this value later in the quickstart. The service connection string is different from the device connection string.

## Send simulated telemetry

The simulated device application connects to a device-specific endpoint on your IoT hub and sends simulated temperature and humidity telemetry.

1. In a terminal window, navigate to the root folder of the sample Node.js project. Then navigate to the **iot-hub\Quickstarts\simulated-device** folder.

1. Open the **SimulatedDevice.js** file in a text editor of your choice.

    Replace the value of the `connectionString` variable with the device connection string you made a note of previously. Then save your changes to **SimulatedDevice.js** file.

1. In the terminal window, run the following commands to install the required libraries and run the simulated device application:

    ```cmd/sh
    npm install
    node SimulatedDevice.js
    ```

    The following screenshot shows the output as the simulated device application sends telemetry to your IoT hub:

## Read the telemetry from your hub

The back-end application connects to the service-side **Events** endpoint on your IoT Hub. The application receives the device-to-cloud messages sent from your simulated device. An IoT Hub back-end application typically runs in the cloud to receive and process device-to-cloud messages.

1. In another terminal window, navigate to the root folder of the sample Node.js project. Then navigate to the **read-d2c-messages** folder.

1. Open the **iot-hub\Quickstarts\ReadDeviceToCloudMessages.js** file in a text editor of your choice.

    Replace the value of the `connectionString` variable with the service connection string you made a note of previously. Then save your changes to the **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages.js** file.

1. In the terminal window, run the following commands to install the required libraries and run the back-end application:

    ```cmd/sh
    npm install
    node ReadDeviceToCloudMessages.js
    ```

    The following screenshot shows the output as the back-end application receives telemetry sent by the simulated device to the hub:

## Clean up resources

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you've setup an IoT hub, registered a device, sent simulated telemetry to the hub using a Node.js application, and read the telemetry from the hub using a simple back-end application.

To learn how to control your simulated device from a back-end application, continue to the next quickstart.
