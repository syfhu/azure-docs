# Create an IoT hub using the New-AzureRmIotHub cmdlet

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-resource-manager-selector](../../includes/iot-hub-resource-manager-selector.md)]

## Introduction

You can use Azure PowerShell cmdlets to create and manage Azure IoT hubs. This tutorial shows you how to create an IoT hub with PowerShell.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources: [Azure Resource Manager and classic](../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model.md). This article covers using the Azure Resource Manager deployment model.

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* An active Azure account. <br/>If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account][lnk-free-trial] in just a couple of minutes.
* [Azure PowerShell cmdlets][lnk-powershell-install].

## Connect to your Azure subscription
In a PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command to sign in to your Azure subscription:

```powershell
Connect-AzureRmAccount
```

If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, signing in to Azure grants you access to all the Azure subscriptions associated with your credentials. Use the following command to list the Azure subscriptions available for you to use:

```powershell
Get-AzureRMSubscription
```

Use the following command to select subscription that you want to use to run the commands to create your IoT hub. You can use either the subscription name or ID from the output of the previous command:

```powershell
Select-AzureRMSubscription `
    -SubscriptionName "{your subscription name}"
```

## Create resource group

You need a resource group to deploy an IoT hub. You can use an existing resource group or create a new one.

You can use the following command to discover the locations where you can deploy an IoT hub:

```powershell
((Get-AzureRmResourceProvider `
  -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Devices).ResourceTypes `
  | Where-Object ResourceTypeName -eq IoTHubs).Locations
```

To create a resource group for your IoT hub in one of the supported locations for IoT Hub, use the following command. This example creates a resource group called **MyIoTRG1** in the **East US** region:

```powershell
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name MyIoTRG1 -Location "East US"
```

## Create an IoT hub

To create an IoT hub in the resource group you created in the previous step, use the following command. This example creates an **S1** hub called **MyTestIoTHub** in the **East US** region:

```powershell
New-AzureRmIotHub `
    -ResourceGroupName MyIoTRG1 `
    -Name MyTestIoTHub `
    -SkuName S1 -Units 1 `
    -Location "East US"
```

The name of the IoT hub must be unique.

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-pii-note-naming-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-pii-note-naming-hub.md)]


You can list all the IoT hubs in your subscription using the following command:

```powershell
Get-AzureRmIotHub
```

The previous example adds an S1 Standard IoT Hub for which you are billed. You can delete the IoT hub using the following command:

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmIotHub `
    -ResourceGroupName MyIoTRG1 `
    -Name MyTestIoTHub
```

Alternatively, you can remove a resource group and all the resources it contains using the following command:

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name MyIoTRG1
```

## Next steps

Now you have deployed an IoT hub using a PowerShell cmdlet, you may want to explore further:

* Discover other [PowerShell cmdlets for working with your IoT hub][lnk-iothub-cmdlets].
* Read about the capabilities of the [IoT Hub resource provider REST API][lnk-rest-api].

To learn more about developing for IoT Hub, see the following articles:

* [Introduction to C SDK][lnk-c-sdk]
* [Azure IoT SDKs][lnk-sdks]
