   ![Edison and sensor connection](media/iot-hub-intel-edison-kit-c-get-started/16_edion_sensor.png)

Now your sensor is ready.

### Power up Edison

1. Plug in the power supply.

   ![Plug in power supply](media/iot-hub-intel-edison-kit-c-get-started/8_plug_power.jpg)

2. A green LED(labeled DS1 on the Arduino* expansion board) should light up and stay lit.

3. Wait one minute for the board to finish booting up.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you do not have a DC power supply, you can still power the board through a USB port. See `Connect Edison to your computer` section for details. Powering your board in this fashion may result in unpredictable behavior from your board, especially when using Wi-Fi or driving motors.

### Connect Edison to your computer

1. Toggle down the microswitch towards the two micro USB ports, so that Edison is in device mode. For differences between device mode and host mode, please reference [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/628233#usb-device-mode-vs-usb-host-mode).

   ![Toggle down the microswitch](media/iot-hub-intel-edison-kit-c-get-started/9_toggle_down_microswitch.jpg)

2. Plug the micro USB cable into the top micro USB port.

   ![Top micro USB port](media/iot-hub-intel-edison-kit-c-get-started/10_top_usbport.jpg)

3. Plug the other end of USB cable into your computer.

   ![Computer USB](media/iot-hub-intel-edison-kit-c-get-started/11_computer_usb.jpg)

4. You will know that your board is fully initialized when your computer mounts a new drive (much like inserting a SD card into your computer).

## Download and run the configuration tool
Get the latest configuration tool from [this link](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/edison/downloads) listed under the `Installers` heading. Execute the tool and follow its on-screen instructions, clicking Next where needed

Congratulations! You've successfully configured Edison.

## Run a sample application on Intel Edison

### Prepare the Azure IoT Device SDK

1. Use one of the following SSH clients from your host computer to connect to your Intel Edison. The IP address is from the configuration tool and the password is the one you've set in that tool.
    - [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) for Windows.
    - The built-in SSH client on Ubuntu or macOS (run `ssh root@"the IP address"`).

2. Clone the sample client app to your device. 
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iot-hub-c-intel-edison-client-app.git
   ```

3. Then navigate to the repo folder to run the following command to build Azure IoT SDK

   ```bash
   cd iot-hub-c-intel-edison-client-app
   sed -i -e 's/\r$//' buildSDK.sh
   chmod 755 buildSDK.sh
   ./buildSDK.sh
   ```

### Configure the sample application

1. Open the config file by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   nano config.h
   ```

   ![Config file](media/iot-hub-intel-edison-kit-c-get-started/13_configure_file.png)

   There are two macros in this file you can configurate. The first one is `INTERVAL`, which defines the time interval between two messages that send to cloud. The second one `SIMULATED_DATA`,which is a Boolean value for whether to use simulated sensor data or not.

   If you **don't have the sensor**, set the `SIMULATED_DATA` value to `1` to make the sample application create and use simulated sensor data.

2. Save and exit by pressing Control-O > Enter > Control-X.

### Build and run the sample application

1. Build the sample application by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cmake . && make
   ```
   ![Build output](media/iot-hub-intel-edison-kit-c-get-started/14_build_output.png)

1. Run the sample application by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo ./app '<your Azure IoT hub device connection string>'
   ```

   > [!NOTE] 
   Make sure you copy-paste the device connection string into the single quotes.

You should see the following output that shows the sensor data and the messages that are sent to your IoT hub.
