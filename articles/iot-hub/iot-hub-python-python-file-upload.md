# Upload files from your device to the cloud with IoT Hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-file-upload-language-selector](../../includes/iot-hub-file-upload-language-selector.md)]

This tutorial follows how to use the [file upload capabilities of IoT Hub](iot-hub-devguide-file-upload.md) to upload a file to [Azure blob storage](../storage/index.yml). The tutorial shows you how to:

- Securely provide a storage container for uploading a file.
- Use the Python client to upload a file through your IoT hub.

The [Get started with IoT Hub](iot-hub-node-node-getstarted.md) tutorial demonstrates the basic device-to-cloud messaging functionality of IoT Hub. However, in some scenarios you cannot easily map the data your devices send into the relatively small device-to-cloud messages that IoT Hub accepts. When you need to upland files from a device, you can still use the security and reliability of IoT Hub.

> [!NOTE]
> IoT Hub Python SDK currently only supports uploading character-based files such as **.txt** files.

At the end of this tutorial you run the Python console app:

* **FileUpload.py**, which uploads a file to storage using the Python Device SDK.

> [!NOTE]
> IoT Hub supports many device platforms and languages (including C, .NET, Javascript, Python, and Java) through Azure IoT device SDKs. Refer to the [Azure IoT Developer Center] for step-by-step instructions on how to connect your device to Azure IoT Hub.

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* [Python 2.x or 3.x][lnk-python-download]. Make sure to use the 32-bit or 64-bit installation as required by your setup. When prompted during the installation, make sure to add Python to your platform-specific environment variable. If you are using Python 2.x, you may need to [install or upgrade *pip*, the Python package management system][lnk-install-pip].
* If you are using Windows OS, then [Visual C++ redistributable package][lnk-visual-c-redist] to allow the use of native DLLs from Python.
* An active Azure account. (If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) in just a couple of minutes.)

## Upload a file from a device app

In this section, you create the device app to upload a file to IoT hub.

1. At your command prompt, run the following command to install the **azure-iothub-device-client** package:

    ```cmd/sh
    pip install azure-iothub-device-client
    ```

1. Using a text editor, create a **FileUpload.py** file in your working folder.

1. Add the following `import` statements and variables at the start of the **FileUpload.py** file. Replace `deviceConnectionString` with the connection string of your IoT hub device:

    ```python
    import time
    import sys
    import iothub_client
    import os
    from iothub_client import IoTHubClient, IoTHubClientError, IoTHubTransportProvider, IoTHubClientResult, IoTHubError

    CONNECTION_STRING = "[Device Connection String]"
    PROTOCOL = IoTHubTransportProvider.HTTP

    PATHTOFILE = "[Full path to file]"
    FILENAME = "[File name on storage after upload]"
    ```

1. Create a callback for the **upload_blob** function:

    ```python
    def blob_upload_conf_callback(result, user_context):
        if str(result) == 'OK':
            print ( "...file uploaded successfully." )
        else:
            print ( "...file upload callback returned: " + str(result) )
    ```

1. Add the following code to connect the client and upload the file. Also include the `main` routine:

    ```python
    def iothub_file_upload_sample_run():
        try:
            print ( "IoT Hub file upload sample, press Ctrl-C to exit" )

            client = IoTHubClient(CONNECTION_STRING, PROTOCOL)

            f = open(PATHTOFILE, "r")
            content = f.read()

            client.upload_blob_async(FILENAME, content, len(content), blob_upload_conf_callback, 0)

            print ( "" )
            print ( "File upload initiated..." )

            while True:
                time.sleep(30)

        except IoTHubError as iothub_error:
            print ( "Unexpected error %s from IoTHub" % iothub_error )
            return
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print ( "IoTHubClient sample stopped" )
        except:
            print ( "generic error" )

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print ( "Simulating a file upload using the Azure IoT Hub Device SDK for Python" )
        print ( "    Protocol %s" % PROTOCOL )
        print ( "    Connection string=%s" % CONNECTION_STRING )

        iothub_file_upload_sample_run()
    ```

1. Save and close the **UploadFile.py** file.

1. Copy a sample text file to the working folder and rename it `sample.txt`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > IoT Hub Python SDK currently only supports uploading character-based files such as **.txt** files.


## Run the application

Now you are ready to run the application.

1. At a command prompt in your working folder, run the following command:

    ```cmd/sh
    python FileUpload.py
    ```

1. The following screenshot shows the output from the **FileUpload** app:

    ![Output from simulated-device app](./media/iot-hub-python-python-file-upload/1.png)

1. You can use the portal to view the uploaded file in the storage container you configured:

    ![Uploaded file](./media/iot-hub-python-python-file-upload/2.png)
