# Troubleshoot Azure File Sync (preview)
Use Azure File Sync (preview) to centralize your organization's file shares in Azure Files, while keeping the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of an on-premises file server. Azure File Sync transforms Windows Server into a quick cache of your Azure file share. You can use any protocol that's available on Windows Server to access your data locally, including SMB, NFS, and FTPS. You can have as many caches as you need across the world.

This article is designed to help you troubleshoot and resolve issues that you might encounter with your Azure File Sync deployment. We also describe how to collect important logs from the system if a deeper investigation of the issue is required. If you don't see the answer to your question, you can contact us through the following channels (in escalating order):

1. The comments section of this article.
2. [Azure Storage Forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/azure/home?forum=windowsazuredata).
3. [Azure Files UserVoice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/217298-storage/category/180670-files). 
4. Microsoft Support. To create a new support request, in the Azure portal, on the **Help** tab, select the **Help + support** button, and then select **New support request**.

## I'm having an issue with Azure File Sync on my server (sync, cloud tiering, etc.). Should I remove and recreate my server endpoint?
[!INCLUDE [storage-sync-files-remove-server-endpoint](../../../includes/storage-sync-files-remove-server-endpoint.md)]

## Storage Sync Service object management
If you do a resource move from one subscription to another subscription, file sync (Storage Sync Service) resources will be blocked from being moved. 

## Agent installation and server registration
### During server registration, get the error "The term 'find-AzureRMResource' is not recognized as the name..."
The issue is that the cmdlet find-AzureRMResource was changed in AzureRM v6.  The next version of the Sync agent will be fixed to support AzureRM v6.  Until then, you can work around this issue by:
1. Stop the current ServerRegistration.exe via taskmgr
2. Bring up a PowerShell command prompt as Administrator
3. PS C:\> Uninstall-Module AzureRM
4. PS C:\> install-module -name AzureRM -RequiredVersion 5.7.0
5. Start C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent\ServerRegistration.exe.

<a id="agent-installation-failures"></a>**Troubleshoot agent installation failures**  
If the Azure File Sync agent installation fails, at an elevated command prompt, run the following command to turn on logging during agent installation:

```
StorageSyncAgent.msi /l*v Installer.log
```

Review installer.log to determine the cause of the installation failure. 

> [!Note]  
> The agent installation will fail if your machine is set up to use Microsoft Update and the Windows Update service is not running.

<a id="agent-installation-on-DC"></a>**Agent installation fails on Active Directory Domain Controller** 
If you try and install the sync agent on an Active Directory domain controller where the PDC role owner is on a Windows Server 2008R2 or below OS version, you may hit the issue where the sync agent will fail to install.

To resolve, transfer the PDC role to another domain controller running Windows Server 2012R2 or more recent, then install sync.

<a id="agent-installation-websitename-failure"></a>**Agent installation fails with this error: "Storage Sync Agent Wizard ended prematurely"**  
This issue can occur with version 1.x agent and if the IIS website default name is changed. To work around this issue, use our 2.0.11+ agent.

<a id="server-registration-missing"></a>**Server is not listed under registered servers in the Azure portal**  
If a server is not listed under **Registered servers** for a Storage Sync Service:
1. Log in to the server that you want to register.
2. Open File Explorer, and then go to the Storage Sync Agent installation directory (the default location is C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent). 
3. Run ServerRegistration.exe, and complete the wizard to register the server with a Storage Sync Service.



<a id="server-already-registered"></a>**Server Registration displays the following message during Azure File Sync agent installation: "This server is already registered"** 

![A screenshot of the Server Registration dialog with the "server is already registered" error message](media/storage-sync-files-troubleshoot/server-registration-1.png)

This message appears if the server was previously registered with a Storage Sync Service. To unregister the server from the current Storage Sync Service and then register with a new Storage Sync Service, complete the steps that are described in [Unregister a server with Azure File Sync](storage-sync-files-server-registration.md#unregister-the-server-with-storage-sync-service).

If the server is not listed under **Registered servers** in the Storage Sync Service, on the server that you want to unregister, run the following PowerShell commands:

```PowerShell
Import-Module "C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent\StorageSync.Management.ServerCmdlets.dll"
Reset-StorageSyncServer
```

> [!Note]  
> If the server is part of a cluster, you can use the optional *Reset-StorageSyncServer -CleanClusterRegistration* parameter to also remove the cluster registration.

<a id="web-site-not-trusted"></a>**When I register a server, I see numerous "web site not trusted" responses. Why?**  
This issue occurs when the **Enhanced Internet Explorer Security** policy is enabled during server registration. For more information about how to correctly disable the **Enhanced Internet Explorer Security** policy, see [Prepare Windows Server to use with Azure File Sync](storage-sync-files-deployment-guide.md#prepare-windows-server-to-use-with-azure-file-sync) and [How to deploy Azure File Sync (preview)](storage-sync-files-deployment-guide.md).

## Sync group management
<a id="cloud-endpoint-using-share"></a>**Cloud endpoint creation fails, with this error: "The specified Azure FileShare is already in use by a different CloudEndpoint"**  
This issue occurs if the Azure file share is already in use by another cloud endpoint. 

If you see this message and the Azure file share currently is not in use by a cloud endpoint, complete the following steps to clear the Azure File Sync metadata on the Azure file share:

> [!Warning]  
> Deleting the metadata on an Azure file share that is currently in use by a cloud endpoint causes Azure File Sync operations to fail. 

1. In the Azure portal, go to your Azure file share.  
2. Right-click the Azure file share, and then select **Edit metadata**.
3. Right-click **SyncService**, and then select **Delete**.

<a id="cloud-endpoint-authfailed"></a>**Cloud endpoint creation fails, with this error: "AuthorizationFailed"**  
This issue occurs if your user account doesn't have sufficient rights to create a cloud endpoint. 

To create a cloud endpoint, your user account must have the following Microsoft Authorization permissions:  
* Read: Get role definition
* Write: Create or update custom role definition
* Read: Get role assignment
* Write: Create role assignment

The following built-in roles have the required Microsoft Authorization permissions:  
* Owner
* User Access Administrator
To determine whether your user account role has the required permissions:  
1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource Groups**.
2. Select the resource group where the storage account is located, and then select **Access control (IAM)**.
3. Select the **role** (for example, Owner or Contributor) for your user account.
4. In the **Resource Provider** list, select **Microsoft Authorization**. 
    * **Role assignment** should have **Read** and **Write** permissions.
    * **Role definition** should have **Read** and **Write** permissions.

<a id="server-endpoint-createjobfailed"></a>**Server endpoint creation fails, with this error: "MgmtServerJobFailed" (Error code: -2134375898)**                                                                                                                    
This issue occurs if the server endpoint path is on the system volume and cloud tiering is enabled. Cloud tiering is not supported on the system volume. To create a server endpoint on the system volume, disable cloud tiering when creating the server endpoint.

<a id="server-endpoint-deletejobexpired"></a>**Server endpoint deletion fails, with this error: "MgmtServerJobExpired"**                
This issue occurs if the server is offline or doesn't have network connectivity. If the server is no longer available, unregister the server in the portal which will delete the server endpoints. To delete the server endpoints, follow the steps that are described in [Unregister a server with Azure File Sync](storage-sync-files-server-registration.md#unregister-the-server-with-storage-sync-service).

<a id="server-endpoint-provisioningfailed"></a>**Unable to open server endpoint properties page or update cloud tiering policy**

This issue can occur if a management operation on the server endpoint fails. If the server endpoint properties page does not open in the Azure portal, updating server endpoint using PowerShell commands from the server may fix this issue. 

```PowerShell
Import-Module "C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent\StorageSync.Management.PowerShell.Cmdlets.dll"
# Get the server endpoint id based on the server endpoint DisplayName property
Get-AzureRmStorageSyncServerEndpoint -SubscriptionId mysubguid -ResourceGroupName myrgname -StorageSyncServiceName storagesvcname -SyncGroupName mysyncgroup

# Update the free space percent policy for the server endpoint
Set-AzureRmStorageSyncServerEndpoint -Id serverendpointid -CloudTiering true -VolumeFreeSpacePercent 60
```

## Sync
<a id="afs-change-detection"></a>**If I created a file directly in my Azure file share over SMB or through the portal, how long does it take for the file to sync to servers in the sync group?**  
[!INCLUDE [storage-sync-files-change-detection](../../../includes/storage-sync-files-change-detection.md)]

<a id="broken-sync"></a>**Sync fails on a server**  
If sync fails on a server:
1. Verify that a server endpoint exists in the Azure portal for the directory that you want to sync to an Azure file share:
    
    ![A screenshot of a sync group with both a cloud endpoint and a server endpoint in the Azure portal](media/storage-sync-files-troubleshoot/sync-troubleshoot-1.png)

2. In Event Viewer, review the operational and diagnostic event logs, located under Applications and Services\Microsoft\FileSync\Agent.
    1. Verify that the server has internet connectivity.
    2. Verify that the Azure File Sync service is running on the server. To do this, open the Services MMC snap-in and verify that the Storage Sync Agent service (FileSyncSvc) is running.

<a id="replica-not-ready"></a>**Sync fails, with this error: "0x80c8300f - The replica is not ready to perform the required operation"**  
This issue is expected if you create a cloud endpoint and use an Azure file share that contains data. The change detection job that scans for changes in the Azure file share is scheduled for once every 24 hours.  The time to complete is dependent on the size of the namespace in the Azure file share.  This error should go away once complete.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure File Sync periodically takes VSS snapshots to sync files that have open handles.
    
We currently do not support resource move to another subscription or, moving to a different Azure AD tenant.  If the subscription moves to a different tenant, the Azure file share becomes inaccessible to our service based on the change in ownership. If the tenant is changed, you will need to delete the server endpoints and the cloud endpoint (see Sync Group Management section for instructions how to clean the Azure file share to be re-used) and recreate the sync group.

<a id="cannot-resolve-storage"></a>**Sync fails, with this error: ": 0x80C83060 - error -2134364064 The storage account name used could not be resolved**
This error can occur for two possible reasons:
1. First check that you can resolve the storage DNS name from the server.
    ```PowerShell
    Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net -Port 443
    ```

2. Under the Access Control (IAM) tab on the storage account, make sure the built-in user **Hybrid File Sync Service** is assigned to the built-in role **Reader and Data Access** and then verify sync is working.

<a id="doesnt-have-enough-free-space"></a>**This PC doesn't have enough free space error**  
If the portal shows the status "This PC doesn't have enough free space" the issue could be that less than 1 GB of free space remains on the volume.  For example, if there is a 1.5GB volume, sync will only be able to utilize .5GB   If you hit this issue, please expand the size of the volume being used for the server endpoint.

## Cloud tiering 
There are two paths for failures in cloud tiering:

- Files can fail to tier, which means that Azure File Sync unsuccessfully attempts to tier a file to Azure Files.
- Files can fail to recall, which means that the Azure File Sync file system filter (StorageSync.sys) fails to download data when a user attempts to access a file which has been tiered.

There are two main classes of failures that can happen via either failure path:

- Cloud storage failures
    - *Transient storage service availability issues*. See [Service Level Agreement (SLA) for Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/storage/v1_2/) for more information.
    - *Inaccessible Azure file share*. This failure typically happens when you delete the Azure file share when it is still a cloud endpoint in a sync group.
    - *Inaccessible storage account*. This failure typically happens when you delete the storage account while it still has an Azure file share which is a cloud endpoint in a sync group. 
- Server failures 
    - *Azure File Sync file system filter (StorageSync.sys) is not loaded*. In order to respond to tiering/recall requests, the Azure File Sync file system filter must be loaded. The filter not being loaded can happen for several reasons, but the most common reason is that an administrator unloaded it manually. The Azure File Sync file system filter must be loaded at all times for Azure File Sync to properly function.
    - *Missing, corrupt, or otherwise broken reparse point*. A reparse point is a special data structure on a file that consists of two parts:
        1. A reparse tag, which indicates to the operating system that the Azure File Sync file system filter (StorageSync.sys) may need to do some action on IO to the file. 
        2. Reparse data, which indicates to the file system filter the URI of the file on the associated cloud endpoint (the Azure file share). 
        
        The most common way a reparse point could become corrupted is if an administrator attempts to modify either the tag or its data. 
    - *Network connectivity issues*. In order to tier or recall a file, the server must have internet connectivity.

The following sections indicate how to troubleshoot cloud tiering issues and determine if an issue is a cloud storage issue or a server issue.

<a id="files-fail-tiering"></a>**Troubleshoot files that fail to tier**  
If files fail to tier to Azure Files:

1. Verify that the files exist in the Azure file share.

    > [!NOTE]
    > A file must be synced to an Azure file share before it can be tiered.
2. In Event Viewer, review the operational and diagnostic event logs, located under Applications and Services\Microsoft\FileSync\Agent.
    1. Verify that the server has internet connectivity. 
    2. Verify that the Azure File Sync filter drivers (StorageSync.sys and StorageSyncGuard.sys) are running:
        - At an elevated command prompt, run `fltmc`. Verify that the StorageSync.sys and StorageSyncGuard.sys file system filter drivers are listed.

<a id="files-fail-recall"></a>**Troubleshoot files that fail to be recalled**  
If files fail to be recalled:
1. In Event Viewer, review the operational and diagnostic event logs, located under Applications and Services\Microsoft\FileSync\Agent.
    1. Verify that the files exist in the Azure file share.
    2. Verify that the server has internet connectivity. 
    3. Verify that the Azure File Sync filter drivers (StorageSync.sys and StorageSyncGuard.sys) are running:
        - At an elevated command prompt, run `fltmc`. Verify that the StorageSync.sys and StorageSyncGuard.sys file system filter drivers are listed.

<a id="files-unexpectedly-recalled"></a>**Troubleshoot files unexpectedly recalled on a server**  
Antivirus, backup, and other applications that read large numbers of files cause unintended recalls unless they respect the skip offline attribute and skip reading the content of those files. Skipping offline files for products that support this option helps avoid unintended recalls during operations like antivirus scans or backup jobs.

Consult with your software vendor to learn how to configure their solution to skip reading offline files.

Unintended recalls also might occur in other scenarios, like when you are browsing files in File Explorer. Opening a folder that has cloud-tiered files in File Explorer on the server might result in unintended recalls. This is even more likely if an antivirus solution is enabled on the server.

## General troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with Azure File Sync on a server, start by completing the following steps:
1. In Event Viewer, review the operational and diagnostic event logs.
    - Sync, tiering, and recall issues are logged in the diagnostic and operational event logs under Applications and Services\Microsoft\FileSync\Agent.
    - Issues related to managing a server (for example, configuration settings) are logged in the operational and diagnostic event logs under Applications and Services\Microsoft\FileSync\Management.
2. Verify that the Azure File Sync service is running on the server:
    - Open the Services MMC snap-in and verify that the Storage Sync Agent service (FileSyncSvc) is running.
3. Verify that the Azure File Sync filter drivers (StorageSync.sys and StorageSyncGuard.sys) are running:
    - At an elevated command prompt, run `fltmc`. Verify that the StorageSync.sys and StorageSyncGuard.sys file system filter drivers are listed.

If the issue is not resolved, run the AFSDiag tool:
1. Create a directory where the AFSDiag output will be saved (for example, C:\Output).
2. Open an elevated PowerShell window, and then run the following commands (press Enter after each command):

    ```PowerShell
    cd "c:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent"
    Import-Module .\afsdiag.ps1
    Debug-Afs c:\output # Note: Use the path created in step 1.
    ```

3. For the Azure File Sync kernel mode trace level, enter **1** (unless otherwise specified, to create more verbose traces), and then press Enter.
4. For the Azure File Sync user mode trace level, enter **1** (unless otherwise specified, to create more verbose traces), and then press Enter.
5. Reproduce the issue. When you're finished, enter **D**.
6. A .zip file that contains logs and trace files is saved to the output directory that you specified.
