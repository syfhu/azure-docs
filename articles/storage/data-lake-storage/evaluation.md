# Guidance for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 customers

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Preview offers native Blob storage functionality, including data tiering, lifecycle management, and enhanced network security, in addition to the Hadoop Compatible file system available in Data Lake Storage Gen1.

If you're an existing Data Lake Storage Gen1 customer, Microsoft encourages you to evaluate all the new and enhanced capabilities of Data Lake Storage Gen2, and provide feedback by [participating in the preview](https://aka.ms/adlsgen2signup). Also, Data Lake Storage Gen1 will continue to be supported. Data Lake Storage Gen1 and Gen2 can coexist, so your existing resources and applications that leverage Data Lake Storage Gen1 continue to work without updates. You can develop a migration plan to Data Lake Storage Gen2 at your convenience.

If you're currently evaluating Data Lake Storage Gen1, Microsoft encourages you to participate in the Gen2 preview and evaluate the new and enhanced capabilities offered by Data Lake Storage Gen2. Similarly, if you're an existing Blob storage customer, Microsoft encourages you to evaluate whether a Hadoop Compatible file system is appropriate for your analytic needs.
