# Azure Storage Scalability and Performance Targets
## Overview
This article describes the scalability and performance topics for Azure Storage. For a summary of other Azure limits, see [Azure Subscription and Service Limits, Quotas, and Constraints](../../azure-subscription-service-limits.md).

> [!NOTE]
> All storage accounts run on the new flat network topology and support the scalability and performance targets outlined in this article, regardless of when they were created. For more information on the Azure Storage flat network architecture and on scalability, see [Microsoft Azure Storage: A Highly Available Cloud Storage Service with Strong Consistency](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2011/11/20/windows-azure-storage-a-highly-available-cloud-storage-service-with-strong-consistency.aspx).
> 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The scalability and performance targets listed here are high-end targets, but are achievable. In all cases, the request rate and bandwidth achieved by your storage account depends upon the size of objects stored, the access patterns utilized, and the type of workload your application performs. Be sure to test your service to determine whether its performance meets your requirements. If possible, avoid sudden spikes in the rate of traffic and ensure that traffic is well-distributed across partitions.
> 
> When your application reaches the limit of what a partition can handle for your workload, Azure Storage begins to return error code 503 (Server Busy) or error code 500 (Operation Timeout) responses. If these errors are occurring, then your application should use an exponential backoff policy for retries. The exponential backoff allows the load on the partition to decrease, and to ease out spikes in traffic to that partition.
>

If the needs of your application exceed the scalability targets of a single storage account, you can build your application to use multiple storage accounts. You can then partition your data objects across those storage accounts. See [Azure Storage Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/) for information on volume pricing.
