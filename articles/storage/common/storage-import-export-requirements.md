# Azure Import/Export system requirements

This article describes the important requirements for your Azure Import/Export service. We recommend that you review the information carefully before you use the Import/Export service and then refer back to it as necessary during the operation.

## Supported operating systems

To prepare the hard drives using the WAImportExport tool, the following **64-bit OS that support BitLocker Drive Encryption** are supported.


|Platform |Version |
|---------|---------|
|Windows     | Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 7 Ultimate <br> Windows 8 Pro, Windows 8 Enterprise, Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 8.1 Enterprise <br> Windows 10        |
|Windows Server     |Windows Server 2008 R2 <br> Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2         |



## Supported storage accounts

Azure Import/Export service supports the following Azure storage accounts.
- Classic
- Blob Storage accounts
- General Purpose v1 storage accounts. 

Each job may be used to transfer data to or from only one storage account. In other words, a single import/export job cannot span across multiple storage accounts. For information on creating a new storage account, see [How to Create a Storage Account](storage-create-storage-account.md#create-a-storage-account).

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The Azure Import Export service does not support storage accounts where the [Virtual Network Service Endpoints](../../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview.md) feature has been enabled. 

## Supported storage types

The following list of storage types is supported with Azure Import/Export service.


|Job  |Storage  |Supported  |Not supported  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Import     |  Azure Blob storage. <br>Block Blobs, Page blobs supported. <br> Azure Files supported.       |         |
|Export     |   Azure Blob storage. <br>Block blobs, Page blobs, and Append blobs supported.       | Azure Files not supported.        |


## Supported hardware 

For the Azure Import/Export service, you need supported disks and supported SATA connectors to copy data.

### Supported disks

The following list of disks is supported for use with the Import/Export service.


|Disk type  |Size  |Supported |Not supported  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|SSD    |   2.5"      |         |         |
|HDD     |  2.5"<br>3.5"       |SATA II, SATA III         |External HDD with built-in USB adaptor <br> Disk inside the casing of an external HDD         |


A single import/export job can have:
- A maximum of 10 HDD/SSDs.
- A mix of HDD/SSD of any size.

Large number of drives can be spread across multiple jobs and there is no limits on the number of jobs that can be created. 

For import jobs, only the first data volume on the drive is processed. The data volume must be formatted with NTFS.

### Supported external USB adaptors

When preparing hard drives and copying the data using the WAImportExport tool, you can use following (off-the-shelf) external USB adaptors: 
- Anker 68UPSATAA-02BU
- Anker 68UPSHHDS-BU
- Startech SATADOCK22UE
- Orico 6628SUS3-C-BK (6628 Series)
- Thermaltake BlacX Hot-Swap SATA External Hard Drive Docking Station (USB 2.0 & eSATA)
