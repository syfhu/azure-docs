# Troubleshooting issues with Update Management

This article discusses solutions to resolve issues that you may encounter when using Update Management

## Windows

If you encounter issues while attempting to onboard the solution on a virtual machine, check the **Operations Manager** event log under **Application and Services Logs** on the local machine for events with event ID **4502** and event message containing **Microsoft.EnterpriseManagement.HealthService.AzureAutomation.HybridAgent**.

The following section highlights specific error messages and a possible resolution for each. For other onboarding issues see, [troubleshoot solution onboarding](onboarding.md).

### <a name="machine-already-registered"></a>Scenario: Machine is already registered to a different account

#### Issue

You receive the following error message:

```error
Unable to Register Machine for Patch Management, Registration Failed with Exception System.InvalidOperationException: {"Message":"Machine is already registered to a different account."}
```

#### Cause

The machine is already onboarded to another workspace for Update Management.

#### Resolution

Perform cleanup of old artifacts on the machine by [deleting the hybrid runbook group](../automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md#remove-a-hybrid-worker-group) and try again.

### <a name="machine-unable-to-communicate"></a>Scenario: Machine is unable to communicate with the service

#### Issue

You receive one of the following error messages:

```
Unable to Register Machine for Patch Management, Registration Failed with Exception System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: An error occurred while sending the request. ---> System.Net.WebException: The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a receive. ---> System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception: The client and server can't communicate, because they do not possess a common algorithm
```

```
Unable to Register Machine for Patch Management, Registration Failed with Exception Newtonsoft.Json.JsonReaderException: Error parsing positive infinity value.
```

```
The certificate presented by the service <wsid>.oms.opinsights.azure.com was not issued by a certificate authority used for Microsoft services. Contact your network administrator to see if they are running a proxy that intercepts TLS/SSL communication.
```

#### Cause

There may be a proxy, gateway or firewall blocking network communication.

#### Resolution

Review your networking and ensure appropriate ports and addresses are allowed. See [network requirements](../automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md#network-planning), for a list of ports and addresses that are required by Update Management and Hybrid Runbook Workers.

### <a name="unable-to-create-selfsigned-cert"></a>Scenario: Unable to create self-signed certificate

#### Issue

You receive one of the following error messages:

```
Unable to Register Machine for Patch Management, Registration Failed with Exception AgentService.HybridRegistration. PowerShell.Certificates.CertificateCreationException: Failed to create a self-signed certificate. ---> System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access is denied.
```

#### Cause

The Hybrid Runbook Worker was not able to generate a self-signed certificate

#### Resolution

Verify system account has read access to folder **C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA** and try again.

## Linux

### Scenario: Update run fails to start

#### Issue

An update runs fail to start on a Linux machine.

#### Cause

The Linux Hybrid Worker is unhealthy.

#### Resolution

Make a copy of the following log file and preserve it for troubleshooting purposes:

```
/var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/run/automationworker/worker.log
```

### Scenario: Update run starts, but encounters errors

#### Issue

An update run starts, but encounters errors during the run.

#### Cause

Possible causes could be:

* Package manager is unhealthy
* Specific packages may interfere with cloud based patching
* Other reasons

#### Resolution

If failures occur during an update run after it starts successfully on Linux, check the job output from the affected machine in the run. You may find specific error messages from your machine's package manager that you can research and take action on. Update Management requires the package manager to be healthy for successful update deployments.

In some cases, package updates can interfere with Update Management preventing an update deployment from completing. If you see that, you'll have to either exclude these packages from future update runs or install them manually yourself.

If you can't resolve a patching issue, make a copy of the following log file and preserve it **before** the next update deployment starts for troubleshooting purposes:

```
/var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/run/automationworker/omsupdatemgmt.log
```
