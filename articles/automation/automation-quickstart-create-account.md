# Create an Azure Automation account

Azure Automation accounts can be created through Azure. This method provides a browser-based user interface for creating and configuring Automation accounts and related resources. This quickstart steps through creating an Automation account and running a runbook in the account.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Log in to Azure

Log in to Azure at https://portal.azure.com

## Create Automation account

1. Click the **Create a resource** button found on the upper left-hand corner of Azure.

1. Select **Monitoring + Management**, and then select **Automation**.

1. Enter the account information. For **Create Azure Run As account**, choose **Yes** so that the artifacts to simplify authentication to Azure are enabled automatically. When complete, click **Create**, to start the Automation account deployment.

1. The Automation account is pinned to the Azure dashboard. When the deployment has completed, the Automation account overview automatically opens.

## Run a runbook

Run one of the tutorial runbooks.

1. Click **Runbooks** under **PROCESS AUTOMATION**. The list of runbooks is displayed. By default several tutorial runbooks are enabled in the account.

1. After the **Job status** becomes **Running**, click **Output** or **All Logs** to view the runbook job output. For this tutorial runbook, the output is a list of your Azure resources.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the resource group, Automation account, and all related resources. To do so, select the resource group for the Automation account and click **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, youâ€™ve deployed an Automation account, started a runbook job, and viewed the job results. To learn more about Azure Automation, continue to the quickstart for creating your first runbook.
