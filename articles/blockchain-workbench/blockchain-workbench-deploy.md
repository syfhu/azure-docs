# Deploy Azure Blockchain Workbench

Azure Blockchain Workbench is deployed using a solution template in the Azure Marketplace. The template simplifies the deployment of components needed to create blockchain applications. Once deployed, Blockchain Workbench provides access to client apps to create and manage users and blockchain applications.

For more information about the components of Blockchain Workbench, see [Azure Blockchain Workbench architecture](blockchain-workbench-architecture.md).

## Prepare for deployment

Blockchain Workbench allows you to deploy a blockchain ledger along with a set of relevant Azure services most often used to build a blockchain-based application. Deploying Blockchain Workbench results in the following Azure services being provisioned within a resource group in your Azure subscription.

* 1 Event Grid Topic
* 1 Service Bus Namespace
* 1 Application Insights
* 1 SQL Database (Standard S0)
* 2 App Services (Standard)
* 2 Azure Key Vaults
* 2 Azure Storage accounts (Standard LRS)
* 2 Virtual machine scale sets (for validator and worker nodes)
* 2 Virtual Networks (including load balancer, network security group, and public IP address for each virtual network)
* Optional: Azure Monitor

The following is an example deployment created in **myblockchain** resource group.

The cost of Blockchain Workbench is an aggregate of the cost of the underlying Azure services. Pricing information for Azure services can be calculated using the [pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).

Azure Blockchain Workbench requires several prerequisites prior to the deployment. The prerequisites include Azure AD configuration and application registrations.

### Blockchain Workbench API app registration

Blockchain Workbench deployment requires registration of an Azure AD application. You need an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant to register the app. You can use an existing tenant or create a new tenant. If you are using an existing Azure AD tenant, you need sufficient permissions to register applications and grant Graph API permissions within an Azure AD tenant. If you do not have sufficient permissions in an existing Azure AD tenant create a new tenant. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Workbench does not have to be deployed in the same tenant as the one you are using to register an Azure AD application. Workbench must be deployed in a tenant where you have sufficient permissions to deploy resources. For more information on Azure AD tenants, see [How to get an Active Directory tenant](../active-directory/develop/active-directory-howto-tenant.md) and [Integrating applications with Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications.md).

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select your account in the top right corner, and switch to the desired Azure AD tenant. The tenant should be the subscription admin's tenant of the subscription where Workbench is deployed and you have sufficient permissions to register applications.
3. In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service. Select **App registrations** > **New application registration**.

4. Provide a **Name** and **Sign-on URL** for the application. You can use placeholder values since the values are changed during the deployment. 

    ![Create app registration](media/blockchain-workbench-deploy/app-registration-create.png)

    |Setting  | Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Name | `Blockchain API` |
    |Application type |Web app / API|
    |Sign-on URL | `https://blockchainapi` |

5. Select **Create** to register the Azure AD application.

### Modify application manifest

Next, you need to modify the application manifest to use application roles within Azure AD to specify Blockchain Workbench administrators.  For more information about application manifests, see [Azure Active Directory application manifest](../active-directory/develop/active-directory-application-manifest.md).

1. For the application you registered, select **Manifest** in the registered application details pane.
2. Generate a GUID. You can generate a GUID using the PowerShell command [guid] :: NewGuid () or New-GUID cmdlet. Another option is to use a GUID generator website.
3. You are going to update the **appRoles** section of the manifest. In the Edit manifest pane, select **Edit** and replace `"appRoles": []` with the provided JSON. Be sure to replace the value for the **id** field with the GUID you generated. 

    ``` json
    "appRoles": [
         {
           "allowedMemberTypes": [
             "User",
             "Application"
           ],
           "displayName": "Administrator",
           "id": "<A unique GUID>",
           "isEnabled": true,
           "description": "Blockchain Workbench administrator role allows creation of applications, user to role assignments, etc.",
           "value": "Administrator"
         }
       ],
    ```

    ![Edit manifest](media/blockchain-workbench-deploy/edit-manifest.png)

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The value **Administrator** is needed to identify Blockchain Workbench administrators.

4.  Click **Save** to save the application manifest changes.

### Add Graph API required permissions

The API application needs to request permission from the user to access the directory. Set the following required permission for the API application:

1. In the Blockchain API app registration, select **Settings > Required permissions > Select an API > Microsoft Graph**.

    ![Select an API](media/blockchain-workbench-deploy/client-app-select-api.png)

    Click **Select**.

2. In **Enable Access** under **Application permissions**, choose **Read all users' full profiles**.

    ![Enable access](media/blockchain-workbench-deploy/client-app-read-perms.png)

    Click **Select** then click **Done**.

3. In **Required permissions**, select **Grant Permissions** then select **Yes** for the verification prompt.

   ![Grant permissions](media/blockchain-workbench-deploy/client-app-grant-permissions.png)

   Granting permission allows Blockchain Workbench to access users in the directory. The read permission is required to search and add members to Blockchain Workbench.

### Add Graph API key to application

Blockchain Workbench uses Azure AD as the main identity management system for users interacting with blockchain applications. In order for Blockchain Workbench to access Azure AD and retrieve user information, such as names and emails, you need to add an access key. Blockchain Workbench uses the key to authenticate with Azure AD.

1. For the application you registered, select **Settings** in the registered application details pane.
2. Select **Keys**.
3. Add a new key by specifying a key **description** and choosing **expires** duration value. 

    ![Create key](media/blockchain-workbench-deploy/app-key-create.png)

    |Setting  | Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    | Description | `Service` |
    | Expires | Choose an expiration duration |

4. Select **Save**. 
5. Copy the value of the key and store it for later. You need it for deployment.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  If you don't save the key for the deployment, you will need to generate a new key. You can't retrieve the key value from the portal later.

### Get application ID

The application ID and tenant information are required for deployment. Collect and store the information for use during deployment.

1. For the application you registered, select **Settings** > **Properties**.
2.  In the **Properties** pane, copy and store the following values for later use during deployment.

    ![API app properties](media/blockchain-workbench-deploy/app-properties.png)

    | Setting to store  | Use in deployment |
    |------------------|-------------------|
    | Application ID | Azure Active Directory setup > Application ID |

### Get tenant domain name

Collect and store the Active Directory tenant domain name where the applications are registered. 

In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service. Select **Custom domain names**. Copy and store the domain name.
