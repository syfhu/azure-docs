# Azure Blockchain Workbench messaging integration

In addition to providing a REST API, Azure Blockchain Workbench also provides messaging-based integration. Workbench publishes ledger-centric events via Azure Event Grid, enabling downstream consumers to ingest data or take action based on these events. For those clients that require reliable messaging, Azure Blockchain Workbench delivers messages to an Azure Service Bus endpoint as well.

Developers have also expressed interest in the ability to have external systems communicate initiate transactions to create users, create contracts, and update contracts on a ledger. While this functionality is not currently exposed in public preview, a sample that delivers that capability can be found at [http://aka.ms/blockchain-workbench-integration-sample](http://aka.ms/blockchain-workbench-integration-sample).

## Event notifications

Event notifications can be used to notify users and downstream systems of events that happen in Blockchain Workbench and the blockchain network it is connected to. Event notifications can be consumed directly in code or used with tools such as Logic Apps and Flow to trigger flow of data to downstream systems.

See [Notification message reference](#notification-message-reference)
for details of various messages that can be received.

### Consuming Event Grid events with Azure Functions

If a user wants to use Event Grid to be notified about events that happen in Blockchain Workbench, you can consume events from Event Grid by using Azure Functions.

1. Create an **Azure Function App** in the Azure portal.
2. Create a new function.
3. Locate the template for Event Grid. Basic template code for reading the message is shown. Modify the code as needed.
4. Save the Function. 
5. Select the Event Grid from Blockchain Workbench’s resource group.

### Consuming Event Grid events with Logic Apps

1.  Create a new **Azure Logic App** in the Azure portal.
2.  When opening the Azure Logic App in the portal, you will be prompted to select a trigger. Select **Azure Event Grid -- When a resource event occurs**.
3. When the workflow designer is displayed, you will be prompted to sign in.
4. Select the Subscription. Resource as **Microsoft.EventGrid.Topics**. Select the **Resource Name** from the name of the resource from the Azure Blockchain Workbench resource group.
5. Select the Event Grid from Blockchain Workbench's resource group.

## Using Service Bus Topics for notifications

Service Bus Topics can be used to notify users about events that happen in Blockchain Workbench. 

1.	Browse to the Service Bus within the Workbench’s resource group.
2.	Select **Topics**.
3.	Select **workbench-external**.
4.	Create a new subscription to this topic. Obtain a key for it.
5.	Create a program, which subscribes to events from this subscription.

### Consuming Service Bus Messages with Logic Apps

1. Create a new **Azure Logic App** in the Azure portal.
2. When opening the Azure Logic App in the portal, you will be prompted to select a trigger. Type **Service Bus** into the search box and select the trigger appropriate for the type of interaction you want to have with the Service Bus. For example, **Service Bus -- When a message is received in a topic subscription (auto-complete)**.
3. When the workflow designer is displayed, specify the connection information for the Service Bus.
4. Select your subscription and specify the topic of **workbench-external**.
5. Develop the logic for your application that utilizes the message from
this trigger.

## Notification message reference

Depending on the **OperationName**, the notification messages have one of the following message types.

### AccountCreated

| Name    | Description  |
|----------|--------------|
| UserId  | ID of the user that was created. |
| ChainIdentifier | Address of the user that was created on the blockchain network. In Ethereum, this would be the user's **on-chain** address. |

``` csharp
public class NewAccountRequest : MessageModelBase
{
  public int UserID { get; set; }
  public string ChainIdentifier { get; set; }
}
```
