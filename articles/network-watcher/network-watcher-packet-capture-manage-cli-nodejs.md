Network Watcher packet capture allows you to create capture sessions to track traffic to and from a virtual machine. Filters are provided for the capture session to ensure you capture only the traffic you want. Packet capture helps to diagnose network anomalies both reactively and proactively. Other uses include gathering network statistics, gaining information on network intrusions, to debug client-server communications and much more. By being able to remotely trigger packet captures, this capability eases the burden of running a packet capture manually and on the desired machine, which saves valuable time.

This article uses cross-platform Azure CLI 1.0, which is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

This article takes you through the different management tasks that are currently available for packet capture.

- [**Start a packet capture**](#start-a-packet-capture)
- [**Stop a packet capture**](#stop-a-packet-capture)
- [**Delete a packet capture**](#delete-a-packet-capture)
- [**Download a packet capture**](#download-a-packet-capture)

## Before you begin

This article assumes you have the following resources:

- An instance of Network Watcher in the region you want to create a packet capture
- A virtual machine with the packet capture extension enabled.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Packet capture requires an agent to be running on the virtual machine. The Agent is installed as an extension. For instructions on VM extensions, visit [Virtual Machine extensions and features](../virtual-machines/windows/extensions-features.md).

## Install VM extension

### Step 1

Run the `azure vm extension set` cmdlet to install the packet capture agent on the guest virtual machine.

For Windows virtual machines:

```azurecli
azure vm extension set -g resourceGroupName -m virtualMachineName -p Microsoft.Azure.NetworkWatcher -r AzureNetworkWatcherExtension -n NetworkWatcherAgentWindows -o 1.4
```

For Linux virtual machines:

```azurecli
azure vm extension set -g resourceGroupName -m virtualMachineName -p Microsoft.Azure.NetworkWatcher -r AzureNetworkWatcherExtension -n NetworkWatcherAgentLinux -o 1.4
````

### Step 2

To ensure that the agent is installed, run the `vm extension get` cmdlet and pass it the resource group and virtual machine name. Check the resulting list to ensure the agent is installed.

```azurecli
azure vm extension get -g resourceGroupName -m virtualMachineName
```

The following sample is an example of the response from running `azure vm extension get`

```
info:    Executing command vm extension get
+ Looking up the VM "virtualMachineName"
data:    Publisher                       Name                        Version  State
data:    ------------------------------  -----------------------     -------  ---------
data:    Microsoft.Azure.NetworkWatcher  NetworkWatcherAgentWindows  1.4      Succeeded
info:    vm extension get command OK
```

## Start a packet capture

Once the preceding steps are complete, the packet capture agent is installed on the virtual machine.

### Step 1

The next step is to retrieve the Network Watcher instance. This variable is passed to the `network watcher show` cmdlet in step 4.

```azurecli
azure network watcher show -g resourceGroup -n networkWatcherName
```

### Step 2

Retrieve a storage account. This storage account is used to store the packet capture file.

```azurecli
azure storage account list
```

### Step 3

Filters can be used to limit the data that is stored by the packet capture. The following example sets up a packet capture with several  filters.  The first three filters collect outgoing TCP traffic only from local IP 10.0.0.3 to destination ports 20, 80 and 443.  The last filter collects only UDP traffic.

```azurecli
azure network watcher packet-capture create -g resourceGroupName -w networkWatcherName -n packetCaptureName -t targetResourceId -o storageAccountResourceId -f "[{\"protocol\":\"TCP\", \"remoteIPAddress\":\"1.1.1.1-255.255.255\",\"localIPAddress\":\"10.0.0.3\", \"remotePort\":\"20\"},{\"protocol\":\"TCP\", \"remoteIPAddress\":\"1.1.1.1-255.255.255\",\"localIPAddress\":\"10.0.0.3\", \"remotePort\":\"80\"},{\"protocol\":\"TCP\", \"remoteIPAddress\":\"1.1.1.1-255.255.255\",\"localIPAddress\":\"10.0.0.3\", \"remotePort\":\"443\"},{\"protocol\":\"UDP\"}]"
```

Multiple filters can be defined for a packet capture. If you are using a complex filter structure, it is better to use filters as a json file to avoid syntax errors. For example, use the flag "-r" (instead of "-f") and pass the location of a json file containing the following filters:

```json
[
    {
        "protocol":"TCP",
        "remoteIPAddress":"1.1.1.1-255.255.255",
        "localIPAddress":"10.0.0.3",
        "remotePort":"20"
    },
    {
        "protocol":"TCP",
        "remoteIPAddress":"1.1.1.1-255.255.255",
        "localIPAddress":"10.0.0.3",
        "remotePort":"80"
    },
    {
        "protocol":"TCP",
        "remoteIPAddress":"1.1.1.1-255.255.255",
        "localIPAddress":"10.0.0.3",
        "remotePort":"443"
    },
    {
        "protocol":"UDP"
    }
]
```


The following example is the expected output from running the `network watcher packet-capture create` cmdlet.

```
data:    Name                            : packetCaptureName
data:    Etag                            : W/"d59bb2d2-dc95-43da-b740-e0ef8fcacecb"
data:    Target                          : /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/testVM
data:    Bytes To Capture Per Packet     : 0
data:    Total Bytes Per Session         : 1073741824
data:    Time Limit In Seconds           : 18000
data:    Storage Location:
data:      Storage Id                    : /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/testStorage
data:      Storage Path                  : https://testStorage.blob.core.windows.net/network-watcher-logs/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourcegroups/testRG/providers/microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/testVM/2017/02/17/packetcapture_01_21_18_145.cap
data:    Filters                         : []
data:    Provisioning State              : Succeeded
info:    network watcher packet-capture create command OK
```

## Get a packet capture

Running the `network watcher packet-capture show` cmdlet, retrieves the status of a currently running, or completed packet capture.

```azurecli
azure network watcher packet-capture show -g resourceGroupName -w networkWatcherName -n packetCaptureName
```

The following example is the output from the `network watcher packet-capture show` cmdlet. The following example is after the capture is complete. The PacketCaptureStatus value is Stopped, with a StopReason of TimeExceeded. This value shows that the packet capture was successful and ran its time.

```
data:    Name                            : packetCaptureName
data:    Etag                            : W/"d59bb2d2-dc95-43da-b740-e0ef8fcacecb"
data:    Target                          : /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/testVM
data:    Bytes To Capture Per Packet     : 0
data:    Total Bytes Per Session         : 1073741824
data:    Time Limit In Seconds           : 18000
data:    Storage Location:
data:      Storage Id                    : /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/testStorage
data:      Storage Path                  : https://testStorage.blob.core.windows.net/network-watcher-logs/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourcegroups/testRG/providers/microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/testVM/2017/02/17/packetcapture_01_21_18_145.cap
data:    Filters                         : []
data:    Provisioning State              : Succeeded
info:    network watcher packet-capture show command OK
```

## Stop a packet capture

By running the `network watcher packet-capture stop` cmdlet, if a capture session is in progress it is stopped.

```azurecli
azure network watcher packet-capture stop -g resourceGroupName -w networkWatcherName -n packetCaptureName
```

> [!NOTE]
> The cmdlet returns no response when ran on a currently running capture session or an existing session that has already stopped.

## Delete a packet capture

```azurecli
azure network watcher packet-capture delete -g resourceGroupName -w networkWatcherName -n packetCaptureName
```

> [!NOTE]
> Deleting a packet capture does not delete the file in the storage account.

## Download a packet capture

Once your packet capture session has completed, the capture file can be uploaded to blob storage or to a local file on the VM. The storage location of the packet capture is defined at creation of the session. A convenient tool to access these capture files saved to a storage account is Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer, which can be downloaded here:  http://storageexplorer.com/

If a storage account is specified, packet capture files are saved to a storage account at the following location:

```
https://{storageAccountName}.blob.core.windows.net/network-watcher-logs/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{storageAccountResourceGroup}/providers/microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/{VMName}/{year}/{month}/{day}/packetCapture_{creationTime}.cap
```
