# Create and manage action groups in the Azure portal
## Overview ##
An action group is a collection of notification preferences defined by the user. Azure Monitor and Service Health alerts are configured to use a specific action group when the alert is triggered. Various alerts may use the same action group or different action groups depending on the user's requirements.

This article shows you how to create and manage action groups in the Azure portal.

Each action is made up of the following properties:

* **Name**: A unique identifier within the action group.  
* **Action type**: Send an Voice call or SMS, send an email, call a webhook, send data to an ITSM tool, call a Logic App, send a push notification to the Azure app, or run an Automation runbook.
* **Details**: The corresponding phone number, email address, webhook URI, or ITSM Connection Details.

For information on how to use Azure Resource Manager templates to configure action groups, see [Action group Resource Manager templates](monitoring-create-action-group-with-resource-manager-template.md).

## Create an action group by using the Azure portal ##
1. In the [portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Monitor**. The **Monitor** blade consolidates all your monitoring settings and data in one view.

2. In the **Settings** section, select **Action groups**.

3. Select **Add action group**, and fill in the fields.

4. Enter a name in the **Action group name** box, and enter a name in the **Short name** box. The short name is used in place of a full action group name when notifications are sent using this group.

5. The **Subscription** box autofills with your current subscription. This subscription is the one in which the action group is saved.

6. Select the **Resource group** in which the action group is saved.

7. Define a list of actions by providing each action's:

    a. **Name**: Enter a unique identifier for this action.

    b. **Action Type**: Select Email/SMS/Push/Voice, Logic App, Webhook, ITSM, or Automation Runbook.

    c. **Details**: Based on the action type, enter a phone number, email address, webhook URI, Azure app, ITSM connection, or Automation runbook. For ITSM Action, additionally specify **Work Item** and other fields your ITSM tool requires.

8. Select **OK** to create the action group.
