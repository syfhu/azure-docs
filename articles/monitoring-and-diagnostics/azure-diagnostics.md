# What is Azure Diagnostics extension
The Azure Diagnostics extension is an agent within Azure that enables the collection of diagnostic data on a deployed application. You can use the diagnostics extension from a number of different sources. Currently supported are Azure Cloud Service (classic) Web and Worker Roles, Virtual Machines, Virtual Machine Scale sets, and Service Fabric. Other Azure services have different diagnostics methods. See [Overview of monitoring in Azure](monitoring-overview.md). 

## Linux Agent
A [Linux version of the extension](../virtual-machines/linux/diagnostic-extension.md) is available for Virtual Machines running Linux. The statistics collected and behavior vary from the Windows version. 

## Data you can collect
The Azure Diagnostics extension can collect the following types of data:

| Data Source | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Performance counters |Operating System and custom performance counters |
| Application Logs |Trace messages written by your application |
| Windows Event logs |Information sent to the Windows event logging system |
| .NET Event Source |Code writing events using the .NET [EventSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventsource.aspx) class |
| IIS Logs |Information about IIS web sites |
| Manifest based ETW |Event Tracing for Windows events generated by any process |
| Crash dumps |Information about the state of the process in the event of an application crash |
| Custom error logs |Logs created by your application or service |
| Azure Diagnostic infrastructure logs |Information about Diagnostics itself |

## Data storage
The extension stores its data in an [Azure Storage account](azure-diagnostics-storage.md) that you specify. 

You can also send it to [Application Insights](../application-insights/app-insights-cloudservices.md). Another option is to stream it to [Event Hub](../event-hubs/event-hubs-what-is-event-hubs.md), which then allows you to send it to non-Azure montoring services. 


## Versioning and configuration schema
See [Azure Diagnostics Version History and Schema](azure-diagnostics-versioning-history.md).


## Next steps
Choose which service you are trying to collect diagnostics on and use the following articles to get started. Use the general Azure diagnostics links for reference for specific tasks.

## Cloud Services using Azure Diagnostics
* If using Visual Studio, see [Use Visual Studio to trace a Cloud Services application](../vs-azure-tools-debug-cloud-services-virtual-machines.md) to get started. Otherwise, see
* [How to monitor Cloud services using Azure Diagnostics](../cloud-services/cloud-services-how-to-monitor.md)
* [Set up Azure Diagnostics in a Cloud Services Application](../cloud-services/cloud-services-dotnet-diagnostics.md)

For more advanced topics, see

* [Using Azure Diagnostics with Application Insights for Cloud Services](../application-insights/app-insights-cloudservices.md)
* [Trace the flow of a Cloud Services application with Azure Diagnostics](../cloud-services/cloud-services-dotnet-diagnostics-trace-flow.md)
* [Use PowerShell to set up diagnostics on Cloud Services](../virtual-machines/windows/ps-extensions-diagnostics.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json)

## Virtual Machines
* If using Visual Studio, see [Use Visual Studio to trace Azure Virtual Machines](../vs-azure-tools-debug-cloud-services-virtual-machines.md) to get started. Otherwise, see
* [Set up Azure Diagnostics on an Azure Virtual Machine](../virtual-machines-dotnet-diagnostics.md)

For more advanced topics, see

* [Use PowerShell to set up diagnostics on Azure Virtual Machines](../virtual-machines/windows/ps-extensions-diagnostics.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json)
* [Create a Windows Virtual machine with monitoring and diagnostics using Azure Resource Manager Template](../virtual-machines/windows/extensions-diagnostics-template.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json)

## Service Fabric
Get started at [Monitor a Service Fabric application](../service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-how-to-monitor-and-diagnose-services-locally.md). Many other Service Fabric diagnostics articles are available in the navigation tree on the left once you get to this article.

## General articles
* Learn to [use Performance Counters in Azure Diagnostics](../cloud-services/diagnostics-performance-counters.md).
* If you have trouble with diagnostics starting or finding your data in Azure storage tables, see [TroubleShooting Azure Diagnostics](azure-diagnostics-troubleshooting.md)
