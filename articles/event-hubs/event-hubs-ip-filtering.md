# Use IP filters

For scenarios in which Azure Event Hubs is only accessible from certain well-known sites, the *IP filter* feature enables you to configure rules for rejecting or accepting traffic originating from specific IPv4 addresses. For example, these addresses may be those of a corporate NAT gateway.

## When to use

Two important use cases in which it is useful to block Event Hubs endpoints for certain IP addresses are as follows:

- Your event hubs should receive traffic only from a specified range of IP addresses and reject everything else. For example, you are using Event Hubs with [Azure Express Route][express-route] to create private connections to your on-premises infrastructure. 
- You need to reject traffic from IP addresses that have been identified as suspicious by the Event Hubs administrator.

## How filter rules are applied

The IP filter rules are applied at the Event Hubs namespace level. Therefore, the rules apply to all connections from clients using any supported protocol.

Any connection attempt from an IP address that matches a rejecting IP rule on the Event Hubs namespace is rejected as unauthorized. The response does not mention the IP rule.

## Default setting

By default, the **IP Filter** grid in the portal for Event Hubs is empty. This default setting means that your event hub accepts connections from any IP address. This default setting is equivalent to a rule that accepts the 0.0.0.0/0 IP address range.

## IP filter rule evaluation

IP filter rules are applied in order, and the first rule that matches the IP address determines the accept or reject action.

For example, if you want to accept addresses in the range 70.37.104.0/24 and reject everything else, the first rule in the grid should accept the address range 70.37.104.0/24. The next rule should reject all addresses by using the range 0.0.0.0/0.

> [!NOTE]
> Rejecting IP addresses can prevent other Azure services (such as Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Virtual Machines, or the Device Explorer in the portal) from interacting with Event Hubs.

### Creating a virtual network rule with Azure Resource Manager templates

The following Resource Manager template enables adding a virtual network rule to an existing Event Hubs namespace.

Template parameters:

- **ipFilterRuleName** must be a unique, case-insensitive, alphanumeric string, up to 128 characters long.
- **ipFilterAction** is either **Reject** or **Accept** as the action to apply for the IP filter rule.
- **ipMask** is a single IPv4 address or a block of IP addresses in CIDR notation. For example, in CIDR notation 70.37.104.0/24 represents the 256 IPv4 addresses from 70.37.104.0 to 70.37.104.255, with 24 indicating the number of significant prefix bits for the range.

        } 
    ]
}
```

To deploy the template, follow the instructions for [Azure Resource Manager][lnk-deploy].
