# Quickstart: Create a Stream Analytics job by using Azure PowerShell

The Azure PowerShell module is used to create and manage Azure resources by using PowerShell cmdlets or scripts. This quickstart details using the Azure PowerShell module to deploy and run an Azure Stream Analytics job. 

The example job reads streaming data from a blob in Azure blob storage. The input data file used in this quickstart contains static data for illustrative purposes only. In a real world scenario, you use streaming input data for a Stream Analytics job. Next, the job transforms the data using the Stream Analytics query language to calculate average temperature when over 100°. Finally, it writes the resulting output events into another file. 

## Before you begin

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account.](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)  

* This quickstart requires the Azure PowerShell module version 3.6 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable AzureRM` to find the version that is installed on your local machine. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps) article. 


## Sign in to Azure

Log in to your Azure subscription with the `Connect-AzureRmAccount` command, and enter your Azure credentials in the pop-up browser:

```powershell
# Log in to your Azure account
Connect-AzureRmAccount
```

After signing in, if you have multiple subscriptions, select the subscription that you would like to use for this quickstart by running the following cmdlets. Make sure to replace <your subscription name> with the name of your subscription:  

```powershell
# List all available subscriptions.
Get-AzureRmSubscription

# Select the Azure subscription you want to use to create the resource group and resources.
Get-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName "<your subscription name>" | Select-AzureRmSubscription
```

## Create a resource group

Create an Azure resource group with [New-AzureRmResourceGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/new-azurermresourcegroup). A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

```powershell
$resourceGroup = "StreamAnalyticsRG"
$location = "WestUS2"
New-AzureRmResourceGroup `
   -Name $resourceGroup `
   -Location $location 
```

## Prepare the input data

Before defining the Stream Analytics job, prepare the data that is configured as input to the job.

1. Download the [sensor sample data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-stream-analytics/master/Samples/GettingStarted/HelloWorldASA-InputStream.json) from GitHub. Right-click the link and **Save Link As...** or **Save target as**.

2. The following PowerShell code block does multiple commands to prepare the input data required by the job. Review the sections to understand the code. 

   1. Create a standard general-purpose storage account using [New-AzureRmStorageAccount](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.storage/New-AzureRmStorageAccount) cmdlet.  This example creates a storage account called mystorageaccount with locally redundant storage(LRS) and blob encryption (enabled by default).  

   2. Retrieve the storage account context `$storageAccount.Context` that defines the storage account to be used. When working with storage accounts, you reference the context instead of repeatedly providing the credentials. 

   3. Create a storage container using [New-AzureStorageContainer](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azure.storage/new-azurestoragecontainer), and upload the [sensor sample data](https://github.com/Azure/azure-stream-analytics/blob/master/Samples/GettingStarted/HelloWorldASA-InputStream.json) that you downloaded earlier. 

   4. Copy the storage key that is outputted by the code, and paste that key in the JSON files for creating the streaming job's input and outputs later on.

   ```powershell
   $storageAccountName = "mystorageaccount"
   $storageAccount = New-AzureRmStorageAccount `
     -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
     -Name $storageAccountName `
     -Location $location `
     -SkuName Standard_LRS `
     -Kind Storage
   
   $ctx = $storageAccount.Context
   $containerName = "streamanalytics"
   
   New-AzureStorageContainer `
     -Name $containerName `
     -Context $ctx
   
   Set-AzureStorageBlobContent `
     -File "c:\HelloWorldASA-InputStream.json" `
     -Blob "input/HelloWorldASA-InputStream.json" `
     -Container $containerName `
     -Context $ctx  
   
   $storageAccountKey = (Get-AzureRmStorageAccountKey `
     -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
     -Name $storageAccountName).Value[0]
   
   Write-Host "The <storage account key> placeholder needs to be replaced in your input and output json files with this key value:" 
   Write-Host $storageAccountKey -ForegroundColor Cyan
   ```

## Create a Stream Analytics job

Create a Stream Analytics job with [New-AzureRmStreamAnalyticsJob](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.streamanalytics/new-azurermstreamanalyticsjob?view=azurermps-5.4.0) cmdlet. This cmdlet takes the job name, resource group name, and the job definition as parameters. The job name can be any friendly name that identifies your job. It can contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores only and it must be between 3 and 63 characters long. The job definition is a JSON file that contains the properties required to create a job. On your local machine, create a file named `JobDefinition.json` and add the following JSON data to it:

```json
{    
   "location":"WestUS2",  
   "properties":{    
      "sku":{    
         "name":"standard"  
      },  
      "eventsOutOfOrderPolicy":"adjust",  
      "eventsOutOfOrderMaxDelayInSeconds":10,  
      "compatibilityLevel": 1.1
   }
}
```

Next, run the `New-AzureRmStreamAnalyticsJob` cmdlet. Make sure to replace the value of `jobDefinitionFile` variable with the path where you have stored the job definition JSON file. 

```powershell
$jobName = "MyStreamingJob"
$jobDefinitionFile = "C:\JobDefinition.json"
New-AzureRmStreamAnalyticsJob `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
  -File $jobDefinitionFile `
  -Name $jobName `
  -Force 
```

## Configure input to the job

Add an input to your job by using the [New-AzureRmStreamAnalyticsInput](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.streamanalytics/new-azurermstreamanalyticsinput?view=azurermps-5.4.0) cmdlet. This cmdlet takes the job name, job input name, resource group name, and the job input definition as parameters. The job input definition is a JSON file that contains the properties required to configure the job’s input. In this example, you will create a blob storage as an input. 

On your local machine, create a file named `JobInputDefinition.json` and add the following JSON data to it. Make sure to replace the value for `accountKey` with your storage account’s access key that is the value stored in $storageAccountKey value. 

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "type": "Stream",
        "datasource": {
            "type": "Microsoft.Storage/Blob",
            "properties": {
                "storageAccounts": [
                {
                   "accountName": "mystorageaccount",
                   "accountKey":"<storage account key>"
                }],
                "container": "streamanalytics",
                "pathPattern": "input/",
                "dateFormat": "yyyy/MM/dd",
                "timeFormat": "HH"
            }
        },
        "serialization": {
            "type": "Json",
            "properties": {
                "encoding": "UTF8"
            }
        }
    },
    "name": "MyBlobInput",
    "type": "Microsoft.StreamAnalytics/streamingjobs/inputs"
}
```

Next, run the `New-AzureRmStreamAnalyticsInput` cmdlet, make sure to replace the value of `jobDefinitionFile` variable with the path where you have stored the job input definition JSON file. 

```powershell
$jobInputName = "MyBlobInput"
$jobInputDefinitionFile = "C:\JobInputDefinition.json"
New-AzureRmStreamAnalyticsInput `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
  -JobName $jobName `
  -File $jobInputDefinitionFile `
  -Name $jobInputName 
```

## Configure output to the job

Add an output to your job by using the [New-AzureRmStreamAnalyticsOutput](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.streamanalytics/new-azurermstreamanalyticsoutput?view=azurermps-5.4.0) cmdlet. This cmdlet takes the job name, job output name, resource group name, and the job output definition as parameters. The job output definition is a JSON file that contains the properties required to configure job’s output. This example uses blob storage as output. 

On your local machine, create a file named `JobOutputDefinition.json`, and add the following JSON data to it. Make sure to replace the value for `accountKey` with your storage account’s access key that is the value stored in $storageAccountKey value. 

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "datasource": {
            "type": "Microsoft.Storage/Blob",
            "properties": {
                "storageAccounts": [
                    {
                      "accountName": "mystorageaccount",
		              "accountKey": "<storage account key>"
                    }],
                "container": "streamanalytics",
                "pathPattern": "output/",
                "dateFormat": "yyyy/MM/dd",
                "timeFormat": "HH"
            }
        },
        "serialization": {
            "type": "Json",
            "properties": {
                "encoding": "UTF8",
			    "format": "LineSeparated"
            }
        }
    },
    "name": "MyBlobOutput",
    "type": "Microsoft.StreamAnalytics/streamingjobs/outputs"
}
```

Next, run the `New-AzureRmStreamAnalyticsOutput` cmdlet. Make sure to replace the value of `jobOutputDefinitionFile` variable with the path where you have stored the job output definition JSON file. 

```powershell
$jobOutputName = "MyBlobOutput"
$jobOutputDefinitionFile = "C:\JobOutputDefinition.json"
New-AzureRmStreamAnalyticsOutput `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
  -JobName $jobName `
  -File $jobOutputDefinitionFile `
  -Name $jobOutputName -Force 
```

## Define the transformation query

Add a transformation your job by using the [New-AzureRmStreamAnalyticsTransformation](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.streamanalytics/new-azurermstreamanalyticstransformation?view=azurermps-5.4.0) cmdlet. This cmdlet takes the job name, job transformation name, resource group name, and the job transformation definition as parameters. On your local machine, create a file named `JobTransformationDefinition.json` and add the following JSON data to it. The JSON file contains a query parameter that defines the transformation query:

```json
{     
   "name":"MyTransformation",  
   "type":"Microsoft.StreamAnalytics/streamingjobs/transformations",  
   "properties":{    
      "streamingUnits":1,  
      "script":null,  
      "query":" SELECT System.Timestamp AS OutputTime, dspl AS SensorName, Avg(temp) AS AvgTemperature INTO MyBlobOutput FROM MyBlobInput TIMESTAMP BY time GROUP BY TumblingWindow(second,30),dspl HAVING Avg(temp)>100"  
   }  
}
```

Next run the `New-AzureRmStreamAnalyticsTransformation` cmdlet. Make sure to replace the value of `jobTransformationDefinitionFile` variable with the path where you have stored the job transformation definition JSON file. 

```powershell
$jobTransformationName = "MyJobTransformation"
$jobTransformationDefinitionFile = "C:\JobTransformationDefinition.json"
New-AzureRmStreamAnalyticsTransformation `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
  -JobName $jobName `
  -File $jobTransformationDefinitionFile `
  -Name $jobTransformationName -Force
```

## Start the Stream Analytics job and check the output

Start the job by using the [Start-AzureRmStreamAnalyticsJob](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.streamanalytics/start-azurermstreamanalyticsjob?view=azurermps-5.4.0) cmdlet. This cmdlet takes the job name, resource group name, output start mode, and start time as parameters. `OutputStartMode` accepts values of `JobStartTime`, `CustomTime`, or `LastOutputEventTime`. To learn more about what each of these values are referring to, see the [parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.streamanalytics/start-azurermstreamanalyticsjob?view=azurermps-5.4.0) section in PowerShell documentation. In this example, specify mode as `CustomTime` and provide a value for the `OutputStartTime`. 

For time value, select `2018-01-01`. This start date is chosen because it precedes the event timestamp from the sample data. After you run the following cmdlet, it returns `True` as output if the job starts. In the storage container, an output folder is created with the transformed data. 

```powershell
Start-AzureRmStreamAnalyticsJob `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
  -Name $jobName `
  -OutputStartMode CustomTime `
  -OutputStartTime 2018-01-01T00:00:00Z 
```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the resource group, the streaming job, and all related resources. Deleting the job avoids billing the streaming units consumed by the job. If you're planning to use the job in future, you can skip deleting it, and stop the job for now. If you are not going to continue to use this job, delete all resources created by this quickstart by running the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup `
  -Name $resourceGroup 
```
