## Choose the correct subscription
1. On the **View** menu, select **Server Explorer** in Visual Studio.

2. Log in with your Azure account. 

## Define input sources
1. In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **Inputs** node and rename **Input.json** to **EntryStream.json**. Double-click **EntryStream.json**.

2. For **Input Alias**, enter **EntryStream**. Note that the input alias is used in query script.

3. For **Source Type**, select **Data Stream**.

4. For **Source**, select **Event Hub**.

5. For **Service Bus Namespace**, select the **TollData** option in the drop-down list.

6. For **Event Hub name**, select **entry**.

7. For **Event Hub Policy Name**, select **RootManageSharedAccessKey** (the default value).

8. For **Event Serialization Format**, select **Json**, and for **Encoding**, select **UTF8**.
   
   Your settings look like this:

## Stream Analytics query
This tutorial attempts to answer several business questions that are related to toll data. We constructed queries that can be used in Stream Analytics to provide relevant answers. Before you start your first Stream Analytics job, let's explore a simple scenario and the query syntax.

### Introduction to Stream Analytics query language
Let's say that you need to count the number of vehicles that enter a toll booth. Because this stream of events is continuous, you have to define a period of time. Let's modify the question to be "How many vehicles enter a toll booth every three minutes?" This measurement is commonly referred to as the tumbling count.

Let's look at the Stream Analytics query that answers this question:

        SELECT TollId, System.Timestamp AS WindowEnd, COUNT(*) AS Count 
        FROM EntryStream TIMESTAMP BY EntryTime 
        GROUP BY TUMBLINGWINDOW(minute, 3), TollId 

As you can see, Stream Analytics uses a query language that's like SQL. It adds a few extensions to specify time-related aspects of the query.

For more details, read about [time management](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt582045.aspx) and [windowing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn835019.aspx) constructs used in the query from MSDN.

Now that you have written your first Stream Analytics query, test it by using sample data files located in your TollApp folder in the following path:

**..\TollApp\TollApp\Data**

This folder contains the following files:

* Entry.json
* Exit.json
* Registration.json

## Question: Number of vehicles entering a toll booth
In the project, double-click **Script.asaql** to open the script in the editor. Paste the script in the previous section into the editor. The query editor supports IntelliSense, syntax coloring, and an error marker.

![Query editor](./media/stream-analytics-tools-for-vs/stream-analytics-tools-for-vs-query-01.png)
 
### Test Stream Analytics queries locally
You can first compile the query to see if there is any syntax error.

1. To validate this query against sample data, use local sample data by right-clicking the input and selecting **Add local input**.
   
   ![Add local input](./media/stream-analytics-tools-for-vs/stream-analytics-tools-for-vs-add-local-input-01.png)
   
2. In the pop-up window, select the sample data from your local path. Select **Save**.
   
   ![Add local input](./media/stream-analytics-tools-for-vs/stream-analytics-tools-for-vs-add-local-input-02.png)
   
   A file named **local_EntryStream.json** is added automatically to your inputs folder.
   
   ![Local input folder file list](./media/stream-analytics-tools-for-vs/stream-analytics-tools-for-vs-add-local-input-03.png)
   
3. Select **Run Locally** in the query editor. Or you can press F5.
   
   ![Run Locally](./media/stream-analytics-tools-for-vs/stream-analytics-tools-for-vs-local-run-01.png)
