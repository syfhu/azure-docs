## Well done!
You've completed the getting started guide! You learned how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Set up Azure Dev Spaces with a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure.
> * Iteratively develop code in containers using VS Code and the command line.
> * Independently develop two separate services, and used Kubernetes' DNS service discovery to make a call to another service.
> * Productively develop and test your code in a team environment.

Now that you've explored Azure Dev Spaces, [share your dev space with a team member](../how-to/share-dev-spaces.md) and help them see how easy it is to collaborate together.
