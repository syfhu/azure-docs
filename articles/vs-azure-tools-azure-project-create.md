# Creating an Azure cloud service project with Visual Studio
The Azure Tools for Visual Studio provides a project template that lets you create an Azure cloud service. Once the project has been created, Visual Studio enables you to configure, debug, and deploy the cloud service to Azure.

## Steps to create an Azure cloud service project in Visual Studio
This section walks you through creating an Azure cloud service project in Visual Studio with one or more web roles.  

1. Start Visual Studio as an administrator.

1. On the main menu, select **File** > **New** > **Project**.

1. Select **Cloud** from the Visual C# or Visual Basic project template nodes, and select **Azure Cloud Service** from the list of templates.

1. Specify which version of the .NET Framework you want to use to develop your project.

1. Enter a name and location for your project and a name for the solution. 

1. Select **OK**.

1. In the **New Microsoft Azure Cloud Service** dialog, select the roles that you want to add, and choose the right arrow button to add them to your solution.

1. To rename a role that you've added, hover on the role in the **New Microsoft Azure Cloud Service** dialog, and, from the context menu, select **Rename**. You can also rename a role within your solution (in the **Solution Explorer**) after it has been added.

The Visual Studio Azure project has associations to the role projects in the solution. The project also includes the *service definition file* and *service configuration file*:

- **Service definition file** - Defines the runtime settings for your application, including what roles are required, endpoints, and virtual machine size. 
- **Service configuration file** - Configures how many instances of a role are run and the values of the settings defined for a role. 

For more information about these files, see [Configure the Roles for an Azure cloud service with Visual Studio](vs-azure-tools-configure-roles-for-cloud-service.md).
