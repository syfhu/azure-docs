# Add a VM to a lab in Azure DevTest Labs
If you have already [created your first VM](devtest-lab-create-first-vm.md), you likely did so from a pre-loaded [marketplace image](devtest-lab-configure-marketplace-images.md). Now, if you want to add subsequent VMs to your lab, you can also choose a *base* that is either a [custom image](devtest-lab-create-template.md) or a [formula](devtest-lab-manage-formulas.md). This tutorial walks you through using the Azure portal to add a VM to a lab in DevTest Labs.

This article also shows you how to manage the artifacts for a VM in your lab.

## Steps to add a VM to a lab in Azure DevTest Labs
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=525040).
1. Select **All Services**, and then select **DevTest Labs** from the list.
1. From the list of labs, select the lab in which you want to create the VM.  
1. On the lab's **Overview** pane, select **+ Add**.  

    ![Add VM button](./media/devtest-lab-add-vm/devtestlab-home-blade-add-vm.png)

1. On the **Choose a base** pane, select a base for the VM.
1. On the **Virtual machine** pane, enter a name for the new virtual machine in the **Virtual machine name** text box.

    ![Lab VM pane](./media/devtest-lab-add-vm/devtestlab-lab-vm-blade.png)

1. Enter a **User Name** that is granted administrator privileges on the virtual machine.  
1. If you want to use a password stored in your [secret store](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-devtest-labs-keep-your-secrets-safe-and-easy-to-use-with-the-new-personal-secret-store), select **Use a saved secret**, and specify a key value that corresponds to your secret (password). Otherwise, enter a password in the text field labeled **Type a value**.
1. The **Virtual machine disk type** determines which storage disk type is allowed for the virtual machines in the lab.
1. Select **Virtual machine size** and select one of the predefined items that specify the processor cores, RAM size, and the hard drive size of the VM to create.
1. Select **Artifacts** and - from the list of artifacts - select and configure the artifacts that you want to add to the base image.
    **Note:** If you're new to DevTest Labs or configuring artifacts, refer to the [Add an existing artifact to a VM](#add-an-existing-artifact-to-a-vm) section, and then return here when finished.
1. Select **Advanced settings** to configure the VM's network options and expiration options. 

   To set an expiration option, choose the calendar icon to specify a date on which the VM will be automatically deleted.  By default, the VM will never expire. 
1. If you want to view or copy the Azure Resource Manager template, refer to the [Save Azure Resource Manager template](#save-azure-resource-manager-template) section, and return here when finished.
1. Select **Create** to add the specified VM to the lab.
1. The lab pane displays the status of the VM's creation - first as **Creating**, then as **Running** after the VM has been started.

> [!NOTE]
> [Add a claimable VM](devtest-lab-add-claimable-vm.md) shows you how to make the VM claimable so that it is available for use by any user in the lab.

## Add an existing artifact to a VM
While creating a VM, you can add existing artifacts. Each lab includes artifacts from the Public DevTest Labs Artifact Repository as 
well as artifacts that you've created and added to your own Artifact Repository.

* Azure DevTest Labs *artifacts* let you specify *actions* that are performed when the VM is provisioned, such as running Windows PowerShell scripts, running Bash commands, and installing software.
* Artifact *parameters* let you customize the artifact for your particular scenario

To discover how to create artifacts, see the article, [Learn how to author your own artifacts for use with DevTest Labs](devtest-lab-artifact-author.md).

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=525040).
1. Select **All Services**, and then select **DevTest Labs** from the list.
1. From the list of labs, select the lab containing the VM with which you want to work.  
1. Select **My virtual machines**.
1. Select the desired VM.
1. Select **Manage artifacts**. 
1. Select **Apply artifacts**.
1. On the **Apply artifacts** pane, select the artifact you wish to add to the VM.
1. On the **Add artifact** pane, enter the required parameter values and any optional parameters that you need.  
1. Select **Add** to add the artifact and return to the **Apply artifacts** pane.
1. Continue adding artifacts as needed for your VM.
1. Once you've added your artifacts, you can [change the order in which the artifacts are run](#change-the-order-in-which-artifacts-are-run). You can also go back to [view or modify an artifact](#view-or-modify-an-artifact).
1. When you're done adding artifacts, select **Apply**

## Change the order in which artifacts are run
By default, the actions of the artifacts are executed in the order in which they are added to the VM. 
The following steps illustrate how to change the order in which the artifacts are run.

1. At the top of the **Apply artifacts** pane, select the link indicating the number of artifacts that have been added to the VM.
   
    ![Number of artifacts added to VM](./media/devtest-lab-add-vm-with-artifacts/devtestlab-add-artifacts-blade-selected-artifacts.png)
1. On the **Selected artifacts** pane, drag and drop the artifacts into the desired order. **Note:** If you have trouble dragging the artifact, make sure that you are dragging from the left side of the artifact. 
1. Select **OK** when done.  

## View or modify an artifact
The following steps illustrate how to view or modify the parameters of an artifact:

1. At the top of the **Apply artifacts** pane, select the link indicating the number of artifacts that have been added to the VM.
   
    ![Number of artifacts added to VM](./media/devtest-lab-add-vm-with-artifacts/devtestlab-add-artifacts-blade-selected-artifacts.png)
1. On the **Selected artifacts** pane, select the artifact that you want to view or edit.  
1. On the **Add artifact** pane, make any needed changes, and select **OK** to close the **Add artifact** pane.
1. Select **OK** to close the **Selected artifacts** pane.

## Save Azure Resource Manager template
An Azure Resource Manager template provides a declarative way to define a repeatable deployment. 
The following steps explain how to save the Azure Resource Manager template for the VM being created.
Once saved, you can use the Azure Resource Manager template to [deploy new VMs with Azure PowerShell](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md#template-deployment).

1. On the **Virtual machine** pane, select **View ARM Template**.
2. On the **View Azure Resource Manager template** pane, select the template text.
3. Copy the selected text to the clipboard.
4. Select **OK** to close the **View Azure Resource Manager Template pane**.
5. Open a text editor.
6. Paste in the template text from the clipboard.
7. Save the file for later use.

## Next steps
* Once the VM has been created, you can connect to the VM by selecting **Connect** on the VM's pane.
