# Install the on-premises data gateway for Azure Logic Apps

Before your logic apps can access data sources on premises, 
you have to install and set up the on-premises data gateway. 
The gateway acts as a bridge that provides quick data transfer 
and encryption between on-premises systems and your logic apps. 
The gateway relays data from on-premises sources 
on encrypted channels through the Azure Service Bus. 
All traffic originates as secure outbound traffic from the gateway agent. 
Learn more about [how the data gateway works](#gateway-cloud-service).

The gateway supports connections to these data sources on premises:

*   BizTalk Server 2016
*   DB2  
*   File System
*   Informix
*   MQ
*   MySQL
*   Oracle Database
*   PostgreSQL
*   SAP Application Server 
*   SAP Message Server
*   SharePoint
*   SQL Server
*   Teradata

These steps show how to first install the on-premises data gateway before you 
[set up a connection between the gateway and your logic apps](./logic-apps-gateway-connection.md). 
For more information about supported connectors, see 
[Connectors for Azure Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/connectors/apis-list). 

For information about how to use the gateway with other services, see these articles:

*   [Microsoft Power BI on-premises data gateway](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/documentation/powerbi-gateway-onprem/)
*   [Azure Analysis Services on-premises data gateway](../analysis-services/analysis-services-gateway.md)
*   [Microsoft Flow on-premises data gateway](https://flow.microsoft.com/documentation/gateway-manage/)
*   [Microsoft PowerApps on-premises data gateway](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/gateway-management/)

<a name="requirements"></a>

## Requirements

**Minimum**

* .NET 4.5 Framework
* 64-bit version of Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 (or later)

**Recommended**

* 8 Core CPU
* 8 GB Memory
* 64-bit version of Windows 2012 R2 (or later)

**Important considerations**

* Install the on-premises data gateway only on a local computer.
You can't install the gateway on a domain controller.

   > [!TIP]
   > You don't have to install the gateway on the same computer as your data source. 
   > To minimize latency, you can install the gateway as close as possible to your data source, 
   > or on the same computer, assuming that you have permissions.

* Don't install the gateway on a computer that turns off, goes to sleep, 
or doesn't connect to the Internet because the gateway can't run under those circumstances. 
Also, gateway performance might suffer over a wireless network.

* During installation, you have to sign in with a 
[work or school account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/sign-up-organization) 
that's managed by Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), not a Microsoft account.

  > [!TIP]
  > If you want to use a Microsoft account that has a 
  > Visual Studio with MSDN subscription, first 
  > [create a directory (tenant) in Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/develop/active-directory-howto-tenant.md) 
  > with your Microsoft account, or use the default directory. 
  > Add a user with a password to the directory, 
  > then give that user access to your subscription. 
  > You can then sign in during gateway installation with this username and password.

  You have to use the same work or school account later in the Azure portal when you create 
  and associate a gateway resource with your gateway installation. You then select this 
  gateway resource when you create the connection between your logic app and the 
  on-premises data source. [Why do I have to use an Azure AD work or school account?](#why-azure-work-school-account)

  > [!TIP]
  > If you signed up for an Office 365 offering and didn't supply your actual work email, 
  > your sign-in address might look like jeff@contoso.onmicrosoft.com. 

* If you have an existing gateway that you set up with 
  an installer that's earlier than version 14.16.6317.4, 
  you can't change your gateway's location by 
  running the latest installer. However, 
  you can use the latest installer to set up 
  a new gateway with the location that you want instead.
  
  If you have a gateway installer that's earlier than 
  version 14.16.6317.4, but you haven't installed 
  your gateway yet, you can download and use the latest installer.

## Install the data gateway

1. [Download and run the gateway installer on a local computer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=820931&clcid=0x409).

2. Review and accept the terms of use and privacy statement.

3. Specify the path on your local computer where you want to install the gateway.

4. When prompted, sign in with your Azure work or school account, 
not a Microsoft account.

   ![Sign in with Azure work or school account](./media/logic-apps-gateway-install/sign-in-gateway-install.png)

5. Now register your installed gateway with the 
[gateway cloud service](#gateway-cloud-service). 
Choose **Register a new gateway on this computer**.

   The gateway cloud service encrypts and stores your 
   data source credentials and gateway details. 
   The service also routes queries and their results 
   between your logic app, the on-premises data gateway, 
   and your data source on premises.

6. Provide a name for your gateway installation. 
Create a recovery key, then confirm your recovery key. 

   > [!IMPORTANT] 
   > Your recovery key must contain at least eight characters. 
   > Make sure that you save and keep the key in a safe place. 
   > You also need this key when you want to migrate, restore, 
   > or take over an existing gateway.

   1. To change the default region for the gateway cloud service 
   and Azure Service Bus used by your gateway installation, 
   choose **Change Region**.

      ![Change region](./media/logic-apps-gateway-install/change-region-gateway-install.png)

      The default region is the region associated with your Azure AD tenant.

   2. On the next pane, open the **Select Region** to 
   choose a different region.

      ![Select another region](./media/logic-apps-gateway-install/select-region-gateway-install.png)

      For example, you might select the same region as your logic app, 
      or select the region closest to your on-premises data source 
      so you can reduce latency. Your gateway resource and logic app 
      can have different locations.

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > You can't change this region after installation. 
      > This region also determines and restricts the location where 
      > you can create the Azure resource for your gateway. 
      > So when you create your gateway resource in Azure, 
      > make sure that the resource location matches the region 
      > that you selected during gateway installation.
      > 
      > If you want to use a different region for your gateway later, 
      > you must set up a new gateway.

   3. When you're ready, choose **Done**.

7. Now follow these steps in the Azure portal so you can 
[create an Azure resource for your gateway](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-connection.md). 

Learn more about [how the data gateway works](#gateway-cloud-service).

## Migrate, restore, or take over an existing gateway

To perform these tasks, you must have the recovery key 
that was specified when the gateway was installed.

1. From your computer's Start menu, choose **On-premises data gateway**.

2. After the installer opens, sign in with the same Azure work or school account 
that was previously used to install the gateway.

3. Choose **Migrate, restore, or take over an existing gateway**.

4. Provide the name and recovery key for the 
gateway that you want to migrate, restore, or take over.

<a name="windows-service-account"></a>

## Windows service account

The on-premises data gateway runs as a Windows service and is set up to 
use `NT SERVICE\PBIEgwService` for the Windows service logon credentials. 
By default, the gateway has the "Log on as a service" right 
for the machine where you install the gateway. 
To create and maintain the gateway in the Azure portal, 
the Windows service account must have at least **Contributor** permissions. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Windows service account differs from the account 
> used for connecting to on-premises data sources, 
> and from the Azure work or school account used to sign in to cloud services.

<a name="restart-gateway"></a>

## Restart the gateway

Like any other Windows service, you can start and stop the service in multiple ways. 
For example, you can open a command prompt with elevated permissions 
on the computer where the gateway is running, and run either these commands:

* To stop the service, run this command:
  
    `net stop PBIEgwService`

* To start the service, run this command:
  
    `net start PBIEgwService`

## Configure a firewall or proxy

The gateway creates an outbound connection to 
[Azure Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/). 
To provide proxy information for your gateway, see 
[Configure proxy settings](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/documentation/powerbi-gateway-proxy/).

To check whether your firewall, or proxy, might block connections, 
confirm whether your machine can actually connect to the internet 
and the [Azure Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/). 
From a PowerShell prompt, run this command:

`Test-NetConnection -ComputerName watchdog.servicebus.windows.net -Port 9350`

> [!NOTE]
> This command only tests network connectivity and connectivity to the Azure Service Bus. 
> So the command doesn't have anything to do with the gateway or the gateway cloud service 
> that encrypts and stores your credentials and gateway details. 
>
> Also, this command is only available on Windows Server 2012 R2 or later, 
> and Windows 8.1 or later. On earlier OS versions, you can use Telnet to 
> test connectivity. Learn more about 
> [Azure Service Bus and hybrid solutions](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-fundamentals-hybrid-solutions.md).

Your results should look similar to this example:

```text
ComputerName           : watchdog.servicebus.windows.net
RemoteAddress          : 70.37.104.240
RemotePort             : 5672
InterfaceAlias         : vEthernet (Broadcom NetXtreme Gigabit Ethernet - Virtual Switch)
SourceAddress          : 10.120.60.105
PingSucceeded          : False
PingReplyDetails (RTT) : 0 ms
TcpTestSucceeded       : True
```

If **TcpTestSucceeded** is not set to **True**, you might be blocked by a firewall. 
If you want to be comprehensive, substitute the **ComputerName** and **Port** values 
with the values listed under [Configure ports](#configure-ports) in this article.

The firewall might also block connections that the Azure Service Bus makes to the Azure datacenters. 
If this scenario happens, approve (unblock) all the IP addresses for those datacenters in your region. 
For those IP addresses, [get the Azure IP addresses list here](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653).

## Configure ports

The gateway creates an outbound connection to [Azure Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/) 
and communicates on outbound ports: TCP 443 (default), 5671, 5672, 9350 through 9354. 
The gateway doesn't require inbound ports. Learn more about 
[Azure Service Bus and hybrid solutions](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-fundamentals-hybrid-solutions.md).

| Domain names | Outbound ports | Description |
| ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| *.analysis.windows.net | 443 | HTTPS | 
| *.login.windows.net | 443 | HTTPS | 
| *.servicebus.windows.net | 5671-5672 | Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) | 
| *.servicebus.windows.net | 443, 9350-9354 | Listeners on Service Bus Relay over TCP (requires 443 for Access Control token acquisition) | 
| *.frontend.clouddatahub.net | 443 | HTTPS | 
| *.core.windows.net | 443 | HTTPS | 
| login.microsoftonline.com | 443 | HTTPS | 
| *.msftncsi.com | 443 | Used to test internet connectivity when the gateway is unreachable by the Power BI service. | 
||||

If you have to approve IP addresses instead of the domains, 
you can download and use the [Microsoft Azure Datacenter IP ranges list](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653). 
In some cases, the Azure Service Bus connections are made with IP Address rather than fully qualified domain names.

## How does the data gateway work?

The data gateway facilitates quick and secure communication between your logic app, 
the gateway cloud service, and your on-premises data source. 

![diagram-for-on-premises-data-gateway-flow](./media/logic-apps-gateway-install/how-on-premises-data-gateway-works-flow-diagram.png)

So when the user in the cloud interacts with an element that's connected to your on-premises data source:

1. The gateway cloud service creates a query, along with the encrypted credentials for the data source, 
and sends the query to the queue for the gateway to process.

2. The gateway cloud service analyzes the query and pushes the request to the Azure Service Bus.

3. The on-premises data gateway polls the Azure Service Bus for pending requests.

4. The gateway gets the query, decrypts the credentials, and connects to the data source with those credentials.

5. The gateway sends the query to the data source for execution.

6. The results are sent from the data source, back to the gateway, and then to the gateway cloud service. 
The gateway cloud service then uses the results.

## Tenant level administration 

There is currently no single place where tenant administrators  can manage all the gateways that other users have installed and configured.  If you’re a tenant administrator, we recommend that you ask the users in your organization to add you as an administrator to every gateway they install. This allows you to manage all the gateways in your organization through the Gateway Settings page or through [PowerShell commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-gateway-high-availability-clusters#powershell-support-for-gateway-clusters). 


## Frequently asked questions

### General

**Q**: Do I need a gateway for data sources in the cloud, such as SQL Azure? <br/>
**A**: No. A gateway connects to on-premises data sources only.

**Q**: Does the gateway have to be installed on the same machine as the data source? <br/>
**A**: No. The gateway connects to the data source using the connection information that was provided. 
Consider the gateway as a client application in this sense. 
The gateway just needs the capability to connect to the server name that was provided.

<a name="why-azure-work-school-account"></a>

**Q**: Why do I have to use an Azure work or school account to sign in? <br/>
**A**: You can only use an Azure work or school account when you install the on-premises data gateway. 
Your sign-in account is stored in a tenant that's managed by Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). 
Usually, your Azure AD account's user principal name (UPN) matches the email address.

**Q**: Where are my credentials stored? <br/>
**A**: The credentials that you enter for a data source are encrypted and stored in the gateway cloud service. 
The credentials are decrypted at the on-premises data gateway.

**Q**: Are there any requirements for network bandwidth? <br/>
**A**: We recommend that your network connection has good throughput. 
Every environment is different, and the amount of data being sent affects the results. 
Using ExpressRoute could help to guarantee a level of throughput between on-premises and the Azure datacenters.
You can use the third-party tool Azure Speed Test app to help gauge your throughput.

**Q**: What is the latency for running queries to a data source from the gateway? What is the best architecture? <br/>
**A**: To reduce network latency, install the gateway as close to the data source as possible. 
If you can install the gateway on the actual data source, this proximity minimizes the latency introduced. 
Consider the datacenters too. For example, if your service uses the West US datacenter, 
and you have SQL Server hosted in an Azure VM, your Azure VM should be in the West US too. 
This proximity minimizes latency and avoids egress charges on the Azure VM.

**Q**: How are results sent back to the cloud? <br/>
**A**: Results are sent through the Azure Service Bus.

**Q**: Are there any inbound connections to the gateway from the cloud? <br/>
**A**: No. The gateway uses outbound connections to Azure Service Bus.

**Q**: What if I block outbound connections? What do I need to open? <br/>
**A**: See the ports and hosts that the gateway uses.

**Q**: What is the actual Windows service called?<br/>
**A**: In Services, the gateway is called Power BI Enterprise Gateway Service.

**Q**: Can the gateway Windows service run with an Azure Active Directory account? <br/>
**A**: No. The Windows service has to have a valid Windows account. By default, 
the service runs with the Service SID, NT SERVICE\PBIEgwService.

### High availability and disaster recovery

**Q**: What options are available for disaster recovery? <br/>
**A**: You can use the recovery key to restore or move a gateway. 
When you install the gateway, specify the recovery key.

**Q**: What is the benefit of the recovery key? <br/>
**A**: The recovery key provides a way to migrate or recover your gateway settings after a disaster.

**Q**: Are there any plans for enabling high availability scenarios with the gateway? <br/>
**A**: Some connectors support high availability scenarios, 
such as the File System connector and others on the way. For more information, 
see [High availability clusters for on-premises data gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-gateway-high-availability-clusters).

## Troubleshooting

[!INCLUDE [existing-gateway-location-changed](../../includes/logic-apps-existing-gateway-location-changed.md)]

**Q**: How can I see what queries are being sent to the on-premises data source? <br/>
**A**: You can enable query tracing, which includes the queries that are sent. 
Remember to change query tracing back to the original value when done troubleshooting. 
Leaving query tracing turned on creates larger logs.

You can also look at tools that your data source has for tracing queries. 
For example, you can use Extended Events or SQL Profiler for SQL Server and Analysis Services.

**Q**: Where are the gateway logs? <br/>
**A**: See Tools later in this article.

### Update to the latest version

Many issues can surface when the gateway version becomes outdated. 
As good general practice, make sure that you use the latest version. 
If you haven't updated the gateway for a month or longer, 
you might consider installing the latest version of the gateway, 
and see if you can reproduce the issue.

### Error: Failed to add user to group. (-2147463168 PBIEgwService Performance Log Users)

You might get this error if you try to install the gateway on a domain controller, which isn't supported. 
Make sure that you deploy the gateway on a machine that isn't a domain controller.

## Tools

### Collect logs from the gateway configurer

You can collect several logs for the gateway. Always start with the logs!

#### Installer logs

`%localappdata%\Temp\Power_BI_Gateway_–Enterprise.log`

#### Configuration logs

`%localappdata%\Microsoft\Power BI Enterprise Gateway\GatewayConfigurator.log`

#### Enterprise gateway service logs

`C:\Users\PBIEgwService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Power BI Enterprise Gateway\EnterpriseGateway.log`

#### Event logs

You can find the Data Management Gateway and PowerBIGateway logs under **Application and Services Logs**.

### Fiddler Trace

[Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) is a free tool from Telerik that monitors HTTP traffic. 
You can see this traffic with the Power BI service from the client machine. 
This service might show errors and other related information.
