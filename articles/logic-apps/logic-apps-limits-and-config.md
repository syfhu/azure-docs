# Limits and configuration information for Azure Logic Apps

This article describes the limits and configuration details for 
creating and running automated workflows with Azure Logic Apps. 
For Microsoft Flow, see [Limits and configuration in Microsoft Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/flow/limits-and-config).

<a name="definition-limits"></a>

## Definition limits

Here are the limits for a single logic app definition:

| Name | Limit | Notes | 
| ---- | ----- | ----- | 
| Actions per workflow | 500 | To extend this limit, you can add nested workflows as needed. |
| Allowed nesting depth for actions | 8 | To extend this limit, you can add nested workflows as needed. | 
| Workflows per region per subscription | 1,000 | | 
| Triggers per workflow | 10 | When working in code view, not the designer | 
| Switch scope cases limit | 25 | | 
| Variables per workflow | 250 | | 
| Characters per expression | 8,192 | | 
| Maximum size for `trackedProperties` | 16,000 characters | 
| Name for `action` or `trigger` | 80 characters | | 
| Length of `description` | 256 characters | | 
| Maximum `parameters` | 50 | | 
| Maximum `outputs` | 10 | | 
||||  

<a name="run-duration-retention-limits"></a>

## Run duration and retention limits

Here are the limits for a single logic app run:

| Name | Limit | Notes | 
|------|-------|-------| 
| Run duration | 90 days | To change this limit, see [change run duration](#change-duration). | 
| Storage retention | 90 days from the run's start time | To change this limit, see [change storage retention](#change-retention). | 
| Minimum recurrence interval | 1 second | | 
| Maximum recurrence interval | 500 days | | 
|||| 

<a name="change-duration"></a>
<a name="change-retention"></a>

### Change run duration and storage retention

You can change this limit to a value between 7 days and 90 days. 
To go above the maximum limit, 
[contact the Logic Apps team](mailto://logicappsemail@microsoft.com) 
for help with your requirements.

1. In the Azure portal, on your logic app's menu, 
choose **Workflow settings**. 

2. Under **Runtime options**, from the **Run history retention in days** list, 
choose **Custom**. 

3. Enter or drag the slider for the number of days you want.

<a name="looping-debatching-limits"></a>

## Looping and debatching limits

Here are the limits for a single logic app run:

| Name | Limit | Notes | 
| ---- | ----- | ----- | 
| Until iterations | 5,000 | | 
| ForEach items | 100,000 | You can use the [query action](../connectors/connectors-native-query.md) to filter larger arrays as needed. | 
| ForEach Parallelism | 50 | The default is 20. <p>To change this default level in a ForEach loop, set the `runtimeConfiguration` property in the `foreach` action. <p>To sequentially run a ForEach loop, set the `operationOptions` property to "Sequential" in the `foreach` action. | 
| SplitOn items | 100,000 | | 
|||| 

<a name="throughput-limits"></a>

## Throughput limits

Here are the limits for a single logic app run:

| Name | Limit | Notes | 
| ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| Actions executions per 5 minutes | 100,000 | To increase the limit to 300,000, you can run a logic app in `High Throughput` mode. To configure high throughput mode, under the `runtimeConfiguration` of the workflow resource, set the `operationOptions` property to `OptimizedForHighThroughput`. <p>**Note**: High throughput mode is in preview. Also, you can distribute a workload across more than one app as needed. | 
| Actions concurrent outgoing calls | ~2,500 | Reduce the number of concurrent requests or reduce the duration as needed. | 
| Runtime endpoint: Concurrent incoming calls | ~1,000 | Reduce the number of concurrent requests or reduce the duration as needed. | 
| Runtime endpoint: Read calls per 5 minutes  | 60,000 | Can distribute workload across more than one app as needed. | 
| Runtime endpoint: Invoke calls per 5 minutes| 45,000 | Can distribute workload across more than one app as needed. | 
|||| 

To go above these limits in normal processing, 
or run load testing that might go above these limits, 
[contact the Logic Apps team](mailto://logicappsemail@microsoft.com) 
for help with your requirements.

<a name="request-limits"></a>

## HTTP Request limits

Here are the limits for a single HTTP 
request or synchronous connector call:

#### Timeout

Some connector operations make asynchronous calls or listen for webhook requests, so the timeout for these operations might be longer than these limits. For more information, see the technical details for the specific connector and also [Workflow triggers and actions](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#http-action).

| Name | Limit | Notes | 
| ---- | ----- | ----- | 
| Outgoing request | 120 seconds | For longer running operations, use an [asynchronous polling pattern](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-api-app.md#async-pattern) or an [until loop](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#until-action). | 
| Synchronous response | 120 seconds | For the original request to get the response, all steps in the response must finish within the limit unless you call another logic app as a nested workflow. For more information, see [Call, trigger, or nest logic apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-http-endpoint.md). | 
|||| 

#### Message size

| Name | Limit | Notes | 
| ---- | ----- | ----- | 
| Message size | 100 MB | To work around this limit, see [Handle large messages with chunking](../logic-apps/logic-apps-handle-large-messages.md). However, some connectors and APIs might not support chunking or even the default limit. | 
| Message size with chunking | 1 GB | This limit applies to actions that natively support chunking or let you enable chunking in their runtime configuration. For more information, see [Handle large messages with chunking](../logic-apps/logic-apps-handle-large-messages.md). | 
| Expression evaluation limit | 131,072 characters | The `@concat()`, `@base64()`, `@string()` expressions can't be longer than this limit. | 
|||| 

#### Retry policy

| Name | Limit | Notes | 
| ---- | ----- | ----- | 
| Retry attempts | 90 | The default is 4. To change the default, use the [retry policy parameter](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md). | 
| Retry max delay | 1 day | To change the default, use the [retry policy parameter](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md). | 
| Retry min delay | 5 seconds | To change the default, use the [retry policy parameter](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md). |
|||| 

<a name="custom-connector-limits"></a>

## Custom connector limits

Here are the limits for custom connectors that you can create from web APIs.

| Name | Limit | 
| ---- | ----- | 
| Number of custom connectors | 1,000 per Azure subscription | 
| Number of requests per minute for each connection created by a custom connector | 500 requests per connection |

## Configuration: IP addresses

### Azure Logic Apps service

All logic apps in a region use the same ranges of IP addresses. 
To support the calls that logic apps directly make with 
[HTTP](../connectors/connectors-native-http.md), 
[HTTP + Swagger](../connectors/connectors-native-http-swagger.md), 
and other HTTP requests, set up your firewall configurations so 
they include these outbound and inbound IP addresses, 
based on where your logic apps exist:

### Connectors

To support the calls that [connectors](../connectors/apis-list.md) make, 
set up your firewall configurations so they include these outbound IP addresses, 
based on the regions where your logic apps exist.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> If you have existing configurations, please update them 
> **as soon as possible before September 1, 2018** so they 
> include and match the IP addresses in this list for the 
> regions where your logic apps exist.
