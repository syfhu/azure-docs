# Partner agreements for B2B communication with Azure Logic Apps and Enterprise Integration Pack

Agreements let business entities communicate seamlessly using industry standard protocols and are the cornerstone for business-to-business (B2B) communication. 
When enabling B2B scenarios for logic apps with the Enterprise Integration Pack, 
an agreement is a communications arrangement between B2B trading partners. 
This agreement is based on the communications that the partners want to 
establish and is protocol or transport-specific.

Enterprise integration supports these protocol or transport standards:

* [AS2](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-as2.md)
* [X12](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12.md)
* [EDIFACT](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-edifact.md)

## Why use agreements

Here are some common benefits when using agreements:

* Enables different organizations and businesses to exchange information in a well-known format.
* Improves efficiency when conducting B2B transactions
* Easy to create, manage, and use when creating enterprise integration apps
