# Monitor an integration runtime in Azure Data Factory  
**Integration runtime** is the compute infrastructure used by Azure Data Factory to provide various data integration capabilities across different network environments. There are three types of integration runtimes offered by Data Factory:

- Azure integration runtime
- Self-hosted integration runtime
- Azure-SSIS integration runtime

To get the status of an instance of integration runtime (IR), run the following PowerShell command: 

```powershell
Get-AzureRmDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntime -DataFactoryName MyDataFactory -ResourceGroupName MyResourceGroup -Name MyAzureIR -Status
``` 

The cmdlet returns different information for different types of integration runtime. This article explains the properties and statuses for each type of integration runtime.  

## Azure integration runtime
The compute resource for an Azure integration runtime is fully managed elastically in Azure. The following table provides descriptions for properties returned by the **Get-AzureRmDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntime** command:

### Properties
The following table provides descriptions of properties returned by the cmdlet for an Azure integration runtime:

| Property | Description |
-------- | ------------- | 
| Name | Name of the Azure integration runtime. |  
| State | Status of the Azure integration runtime. | 
| Location | Location of the Azure integration runtime. For details about location of an Azure integration runtime, see [Introduction to integration runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md). |
| DataFactoryName | Name of the data factory that the Azure integration runtime belongs to. | 
| ResourceGroupName | Name of the resource group that the data factory belongs to.  |
| Description | Description of the integration runtime.  |

### Status
The following table provides possible statuses of an Azure integration runtime:

| Status | Comments/Scenarios | 
| ------ | ------------------ |
| Online | The Azure integration runtime is online and ready to be used. | 
| Offline | The Azure integration runtime is offline due to an internal error. |

## Self-hosted integration runtime
This section provides descriptions for properties returned by the Get-AzureRmDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntime cmdlet. 

> [!NOTE] 
> The returned properties and status contain information about overall self-hosted integration runtime and each node in the runtime.  

### Properties

The following table provides descriptions of monitoring Properties for **each node**:

| Property | Description | 
| -------- | ----------- | 
| Name | Name of the self-hosted integration runtime and nodes associated with it. Node is an on-premises Windows machine that has the self-hosted integration runtime installed on it. |  
| Status | The status of the overall self-hosted integration runtime and each node. Example: Online/Offline/Limited/etc. For information about these statuses, see the next section. | 
| Version | The version of self-hosted integration runtime and each node. The version of the self-hosted integration runtime is determined based on version of majority of nodes in the group. If there are nodes with different versions in the self-hosted integration runtime setup, only the nodes with the same version number as the logical self-hosted integration runtime function properly. Others are in the limited mode and need to be manually updated (only in case auto-update fails). | 
| Available memory | Available memory on a self-hosted integration runtime node. This value is a near real-time snapshot. | 
| CPU utilization | CPU utilization of a self-hosted integration runtime node. This value is a near real-time snapshot. |
| Networking (In/Out) | Network utilization of a self-hosted integration runtime node. This value is a near real-time snapshot. | 
| Concurrent Jobs (Running/ Limit) | Number of jobs or tasks running on each node. This value is a near real-time snapshot. Limit signifies the maximum concurrent jobs for each node. This value is defined based on the machine size. You can increase the limit to scale up concurrent job execution in advanced scenarios, where CPU/memory/network is under-utilized, but activities are timing out. This capability is also available with a single-node self-hosted integration runtime. |
| Role | There are two types of roles in a multi-node self-hosted integration runtime â€“ dispatcher and worker. All nodes are workers, which means they can all be used to execute jobs. There is only one dispatcher node, which is used to pull tasks/jobs from cloud services and dispatch them to different worker nodes. The dispatcher node is also a worker node. |

Some settings of the properties make more sense when there are two or more nodes (scale out scenario) in the self-hosted integration runtime. 
  
### Status (per node)
The following table provides possible statuses of a self-hosted integration runtime node:

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ------------------ | 
| Online | Node is connected to the Data Factory service. |
| Offline | Node is offline. |
| Upgrading | The node is being auto-updated. |
| Limited | Due to a connectivity issue. May be due to HTTP port 8050 issue, service bus connectivity issue, or a credential sync issue. |
| Inactive | Node is in a configuration different from the configuration of other majority nodes. |

A node can be inactive when it cannot connect to other nodes.

### Status (overall self-hosted integration runtime)
The following table provides possible statuses of a self-hosted integration runtime. This status depends on statuses of all nodes that belong to the runtime. 

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- | 
| Need Registration | No node is registered to this self-hosted integration runtime yet. |
| Online | All nodes are online. |
| Offline | No node is online. |
| Limited | Not all nodes in this self-hosted integration runtime are in a healthy state. This status is a warning that some nodes might be down. This status could be due to a credential sync issue on dispatcher/worker node. |

Use the **Get-AzureRmDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntimeMetric** cmdlet to fetch the JSON payload containing the detailed self-hosted integration runtime properties, and their snapshot values during the time of execution of the cmdlet.

```powershell
Get-AzureRmDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntimeMetric -name $integrationRuntimeName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -DataFactoryName $dataFactoryName  | | ConvertTo-Json 
```

Sample output (assumes that there are two nodes associated with this self-hosted integration runtime):

```json
{
	"IntegrationRuntimeName":  "<Name of your integration runtime>",
    "ResourceGroupName":  "<Resource Group Name>",
    "DataFactoryName":  "<Data Factory Name>",
    "Nodes":  [
		{
			"NodeName":  "<Node Name>",
			"AvailableMemoryInMB":  <Value>,
			"CpuUtilization":  <Value>,
			"ConcurrentJobsLimit":  <Value>,
			"ConcurrentJobsRunning":  <Value>,
			"MaxConcurrentJobs":  <Value>,
			"SentBytes":  <Value>,
			"ReceivedBytes":  <Value>
		},
		{
			"NodeName":  "<Node Name>",
			"AvailableMemoryInMB":  <Value>,
			"CpuUtilization":  <Value>,
			"ConcurrentJobsLimit":  <Value>,
			"ConcurrentJobsRunning":  <Value>,
			"MaxConcurrentJobs":  <Value>,
			"SentBytes":  <Value>,
			"ReceivedBytes":  <Value>
		}

	]
} 
```


## Azure-SSIS integration runtime
