# Copy data to or from Azure Blob storage by using Azure Data Factory
> [!div class="op_single_selector" title1="Select the version of Data Factory service you are using:"]
> * [Version 1](v1/data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md)
> * [Current version](connector-azure-blob-storage.md)

This article outlines how to use Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data to and from Azure Blob storage. It builds on the [Copy Activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of Copy Activity.

## Supported capabilities

You can copy data from any supported source data store to Blob storage. You also can copy data from Blob storage to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources or sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md) table.

Specifically, this Blob storage connector supports:

- Copying blobs to and from general-purpose Azure storage accounts and hot/cool blob storage. 
- Copying blobs by using both account key and service shared access signature authentications.
- Copying blobs from block, append, or page blobs and copying data to only block blobs. Azure Premium Storage isn't supported as a sink because it's backed by page blobs.
- Copying blobs as is or parsing or generating blobs with [supported file formats and compression codecs](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs.md).

## Get started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Blob storage.

## Linked service properties

### Use an account key

You can create a Storage linked service by using the account key. It provides the data factory with global access to Storage. The following properties are supported.

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to **AzureStorage**. |Yes |
| connectionString | Specify the information needed to connect to Storage for the connectionString property. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). |Yes |
| connectVia | The [integration runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. You can use Azure Integration Runtime or Self-hosted Integration Runtime (if your data store is in a private network). If not specified, it uses the default Azure Integration Runtime. |No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "AzureStorage",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<accountname>;AccountKey=<accountkey>"
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

### Use service shared access signature authentication

You also can create a Storage linked service by using a shared access signature. It provides the data factory with restricted/time-bound access to all/specific resources (blob/container) in the storage.

A shared access signature provides delegated access to resources in your storage account. You can use a shared access signature to grant a client limited permissions to objects in your storage account for a specified time. You don't have to share your account access keys. The shared access signature is a URI that encompasses in its query parameters all the information necessary for authenticated access to a storage resource. To access storage resources with the shared access signature, the client only needs to pass in the shared access signature to the appropriate constructor or method. For more information about shared access signatures, see [Shared access signatures: Understand the shared access signature model](../storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Data Factory now supports both service shared access signatures and account shared access signatures. For more information about these two types and how to construct them, see [Types of shared access signatures](../storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1.md#types-of-shared-access-signatures). 

> [!TIP]
> To generate a service shared access signature for your storage account, you can execute the following PowerShell commands. Replace the placeholders and grant the needed permission.
> `$context = New-AzureStorageContext -StorageAccountName <accountName> -StorageAccountKey <accountKey>`
> `New-AzureStorageContainerSASToken -Name <containerName> -Context $context -Permission rwdl -StartTime <startTime> -ExpiryTime <endTime> -FullUri`

To use service shared access signature authentication, the following properties are supported.

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to **AzureStorage**. |Yes |
| sasUri | Specify the shared access signature URI to the Storage resources, such as blob, container, or table. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). |Yes |
| connectVia | The [integration runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. You can use the Azure Integration Runtime or the Self-hosted Integration Runtime (if your data store is located in a private network). If not specified, it uses the default Azure Integration Runtime. |No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "AzureStorage",
        "typeProperties": {
            "sasUri": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<SAS URI of the Azure Storage resource>"
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

When you create a shared access signature URI, consider the following points:

- Set appropriate read/write permissions on objects based on how the linked service (read, write, read/write) is used in your data factory.
- Set **Expiry time** appropriately. Make sure that the access to Storage objects doesn't expire within the active period of the pipeline.
- The URI should be created at the right container/blob or table level based on the need. A shared access signature URI to a blob allows Data Factory to access that particular blob. A shared access signature URI to an Blob storage container allows Data Factory to iterate through blobs in that container. To provide access to more or fewer objects later, or to update the shared access signature URI, remember to update the linked service with the new URI.

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [Datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by the Blob storage dataset.

To copy data to and from Blob storage, set the type property of the dataset to **AzureBlob**. The following properties are supported.

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to **AzureBlob**. |Yes |
| folderPath | Path to the container and folder in the blob storage. Wildcard filter is not supported. An example is myblobcontainer/myblobfolder/. |Yes |
| fileName | **Name or wildcard filter** for the blob(s) under the specified "folderPath". If you don't specify a value for this property, the dataset points to all blobs in the folder. <br/><br/>For filter, allowed wildcards are: `*` (matches zero or more characters) and `?` (matches zero or single character).<br/>- Example 1: `"fileName": "*.csv"`<br/>- Example 2: `"fileName": "???20180427.txt"`<br/>Use `^` to escape if your actual file name has wildcard or this escape char inside.<br/><br/>When fileName isn't specified for an output dataset and **preserveHierarchy** isn't specified in the activity sink, the copy activity automatically generates the blob name with the following pattern: "*Data.[activity run id GUID].[GUID if FlattenHierarchy].[format if configured].[compression if configured]*". An example is "Data.0a405f8a-93ff-4c6f-b3be-f69616f1df7a.txt.gz". |No |
| format | If you want to copy files as is between file-based stores (binary copy), skip the format section in both the input and output dataset definitions.<br/><br/>If you want to parse or generate files with a specific format, the following file format types are supported: **TextFormat**, **JsonFormat**, **AvroFormat**, **OrcFormat**, and **ParquetFormat**. Set the **type** property under **format** to one of these values. For more information, see the [Text format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs.md#text-format), [JSON format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs.md#json-format), [Avro format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs.md#avro-format), [Orc format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs.md#orc-format), and [Parquet format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs.md#parquet-format) sections. |No (only for binary copy scenario) |
| compression | Specify the type and level of compression for the data. For more information, see [Supported file formats and compression codecs](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs.md#compression-support).<br/>Supported types are **GZip**, **Deflate**, **BZip2**, and **ZipDeflate**.<br/>Supported levels are **Optimal** and **Fastest**. |No |

>[!TIP]
>To copy all blobs under a folder, specify **folderPath** only.<br>To copy a single blob with a given name, specify **folderPath** with folder part and **fileName** with file name.<br>To copy a subset of blobs under a folder, specify **folderPath** with folder part and **fileName** with wildcard filter. 

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "AzureBlobDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "AzureBlob",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Azure Storage linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "typeProperties": {
            "folderPath": "mycontainer/myfolder",
            "fileName": "myfile.csv.gz",
            "format": {
                "type": "TextFormat",
                "columnDelimiter": ",",
                "rowDelimiter": "\n"
            },
            "compression": {
                "type": "GZip",
                "level": "Optimal"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by the Blob storage source and sink.

### Blob storage as a source type

To copy data from Blob storage, set the source type in the copy activity to **BlobSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section.

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to **BlobSource**. |Yes |
| recursive | Indicates whether the data is read recursively from the subfolders or only from the specified folder. Note that when recursive is set to true and the sink is a file-based store, an empty folder or subfolder isn't copied or created at the sink.<br/>Allowed values are **true** (default) and **false**. | No |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromBlob",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Azure Blob input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "BlobSource",
                "recursive": true
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

### Blob storage as a sink type

To copy data to Blob storage, set the sink type in the copy activity to **BlobSink**. The following properties are supported in the **sink** section.

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity sink must be set to **BlobSink**. |Yes |
| copyBehavior | Defines the copy behavior when the source is files from a file-based data store.<br/><br/>Allowed values are:<br/><b>- PreserveHierarchy (default)</b>: Preserves the file hierarchy in the target folder. The relative path of source file to source folder is identical to the relative path of target file to target folder.<br/><b>- FlattenHierarchy</b>: All files from the source folder are in the first level of the target folder. The target files have autogenerated names. <br/><b>- MergeFiles</b>: Merges all files from the source folder to one file. If the file or blob name is specified, the merged file name is the specified name. Otherwise, it's an autogenerated file name. | No |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyToBlob",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Azure Blob output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "<source type>"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "BlobSink",
                "copyBehavior": "PreserveHierarchy"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
