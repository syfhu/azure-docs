# Alert and Monitor data factories using Azure Monitor
Cloud applications are complex with many moving parts. Monitoring provides data to ensure that your application stays up and running in a healthy state. It also helps you to stave off potential problems or troubleshoot past ones. In addition, you can use monitoring data to gain deep insights about your application. This knowledge can help you to improve application performance or maintainability, or automate actions that would otherwise require manual intervention.

Azure Monitor provides base level infrastructure metrics and logs for most services in Microsoft Azure. For details, see [monitoring overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-azure-monitor). Azure Diagnostic logs are logs emitted by a resource that provide rich, frequent data about the operation of that resource. Data Factory outputs diagnostic logs in Azure Monitor.

## Persist Data Factory Data
Data Factory only stores pipeline run data for 45 days. If you want to persist pipeline run data for more than 45 days, using Azure Monitor, you can not only route diagnostic logs for analysis, you can persist them into a storage account so you have factory information for the duration of your chossing.

## Diagnostic logs

* Save them to a **Storage Account** for auditing or manual inspection. You can specify the retention time (in days) using the diagnostic settings.
* Stream them to **Event Hubs** for ingestion by a third-party service or custom analytics solution such as PowerBI.
* Analyze them with **Log Analytics**

You can use a storage account or event hub namespace that is not in the same subscription as the resource that is emitting logs. The user who configures the setting must have the appropriate role-based access control (RBAC) access to both subscriptions.

## Set up diagnostic logs

### Diagnostic Settings
Diagnostic Logs for non-compute resources are configured using diagnostic settings. Diagnostic settings for a resource control:

* Where diagnostic logs are sent (Storage Account, Event Hubs, and/or Log Analytics).
* Which log categories are sent.
* How long each log category should be retained in a storage account
* A retention of zero days means logs are kept forever. Otherwise, the value can be any number of days between 1 and 2147483647.
* If retention policies are set but storing logs in a storage account is disabled (for example, only Event Hubs or Log Analytics options are selected), the retention policies have no effect.
* Retention policies are applied per-day, so at the end of a day (UTC), logs from the day that is now beyond the retention policy are deleted. For example, if you had a retention policy of one day, at the beginning of the day today the logs from the day before yesterday would be deleted.

### Enable diagnostic logs via REST APIs

Create or update a diagnostics setting in Azure Monitor REST API

**Request**
```
PUT
https://management.azure.com/{resource-id}/providers/microsoft.insights/diagnosticSettings/service?api-version={api-version}
```

**Headers**
* Replace `{api-version}` with `2016-09-01`.
* Replace `{resource-id}` with the resource ID of the resource for which you would like to edit diagnostic settings. For more information [Using Resource groups to manage your Azure resources](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-portal.md).
* Set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.
* Set the authorization header to a JSON web token that you obtain from Azure Active Directory. For more information, see [Authenticating requests](../active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-scenarios.md).

## Metrics

Azure Monitor enables you to consume telemetry to gain visibility into the performance and health of your workloads on Azure. The most important type of Azure telemetry data is the metrics (also called performance counters) emitted by most Azure resources. Azure Monitor provides several ways to configure and consume these metrics for monitoring and troubleshooting.

ADFV2 emits the following metrics

| **Metric**           | **Metric Display Name**         | **Unit** | **Aggregation Type** | **Description**                                       |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|----------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| PipelineSucceededRun | Succeeded pipeline runs metrics | Count    | Total                | Total pipelines runs succeeded within a minute window |
| PipelineFailedRuns   | Failed pipeline runs metrics    | Count    | Total                | Total pipelines runs failed within a minute window    |
| ActiviySucceededRuns | Succeeded activity runs metrics | Count    | Total                | Total activity runs succeeded within a minute window  |
| ActivityFailedRuns   | Failed activity runs metrics    | Count    | Total                | Total activity runs failed within a minute window     |
| TriggerSucceededRuns | Succeeded trigger runs metrics  | Count    | Total                | Total trigger runs succeeded within a minute window   |
| TriggerFailedRuns    | Failed trigger runs metrics     | Count    | Total                | Total trigger runs failed within a minute window      |

To access the metrics, follow the instructions in the article - https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-metrics

## Alerts

You can raise alerts on supported metrics in Data Factory. Click
the **Alerts** button on the Data Factory **Monitor** page.

![Alerts option](media/monitor-using-azure-monitor/alerts_image1.png)

This takes you to the **Alerts** page.

![Alerts page](media/monitor-using-azure-monitor/alerts_image2.png)

You can also log in to the Azure portal and click **Monitor -&gt; Alerts** to
reach the **Alerts** page directly.

![Alerts in the portal menu](media/monitor-using-azure-monitor/alerts_image3.png)

### Create Alerts

1.  Click **+ New Alert rule** to create a new alert.

    ![New alert rule](media/monitor-using-azure-monitor/alerts_image4.png)

2.  Define the **Alert condition**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Make sure to select **All** in the **Filter by resource type**.

    ![Alert condition, screen 3 of 3](media/monitor-using-azure-monitor/alerts_image7.png)

3.  Define the **Alert details**.

    ![Alert details](media/monitor-using-azure-monitor/alerts_image8.png)

4.  Define the **Action group**.

    ![Action group, screen 1 of 4](media/monitor-using-azure-monitor/alerts_image9.png)

    ![Action group, screen 2 of 4](media/monitor-using-azure-monitor/alerts_image10.png)
