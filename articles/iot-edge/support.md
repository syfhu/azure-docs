# Azure IoT Edge Support
There are a variety of ways to seek support for the Azure IoT Edge product.

**Reporting bugs** – The majority of development that goes into the Azure IoT Edge product happens in the IoT Edge open-source project. Bugs can be reported on the [issues page](https://github.com/azure/iotedge/issues) of the project. Fixes rapidly make their way from the project in to product updates.

**Microsoft Customer Support team** – Users who have a [support plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/) can engage the Microsoft Customer Support team by creating a support ticket directly from the [Azure portal]( https://ms.portal.azure.com/signin/index/?feature.settingsportalinstance=mpac).

**Feature requests** – The Azure IoT Edge product tracks feature requests via the product’s [User Voice page](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/907045-azure-iot-edge).

## Operating Systems
Azure IoT Edge runs on most operating systems that can run containers; however, all of these are not equally supported. Operating systems are grouped into tiers that represent the level of support users can expect.

### Tier 1
Tier 1 systems can be thought of as officially supported. This means that Microsoft:
* has these operating system in automated tests
* provides installation packages for them

Generally Available
* Ubuntu Server 18.04
* Ubuntu Server 16.04
* Raspbian-stretch

Public Preview
* Windows 10 Server 1803
* Windows 10 IoT Enterprise (with April 2018 update)
* Windows 10 IoT Core (with April 2018 update)

### Tier 2
Tier 2 systems can be thought of as compatible with Azure IoT Edge and can be used relatively easily. This means that:
* Microsoft has done ad-hoc testing on the platforms or knows of a partner successfully running Azure IoT Edge on the platform
* Installation packages for other platforms may work on these platforms

Ubuntu 18.04

Ubuntu 16.04

Wind River 8

Yocto

Debian

Mac

## Container engines
Azure IoT Edge needs a container engine to launch modules, regardless of the operating system on which it is running. Microsoft provides a container engine, moby-engine, to fulfill this requirement. It is based on the Moby open-source project. Docker CE and Docker EE are other popular container engines. They are also based on the Moby opens-source project and are compatible with Azure IoT Edge. Microsoft provides best effort support for systems using those container engines; however, Microsoft does not have the ability to ship fixes for issues in them. For this reason, Microsoft recommends using moby-engine on production systems.
