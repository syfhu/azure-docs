# Cloud Cruiser and Microsoft Azure Billing API Integration
This article describes how the information collected from the new Microsoft Azure Billing APIs can be used in Cloud Cruiser for workflow cost simulation and analysis.

## Azure RateCard API
The RateCard API provides rate information from Azure. After authenticating with the proper credentials, you can query the API to collect metadata about the services available on Azure, along with the rates associated with your Offer ID.

The following sample response is from the API showing the prices for the A0 (Windows) instance:

    {
        "MeterId": "0e59ad56-03e5-4c3d-90d4-6670874d7e29",
        "MeterName": "Compute Hours",
        "MeterCategory": "Virtual Machines",
        "MeterSubCategory": "A0 VM (Windows)",
        "Unit": "Hours",
        "MeterRates":
        {
            "0": 0.029
        },
        "EffectiveDate": "2014-08-01T00:00:00Z",
        "IncludedQuantity": 0.0,
        "MeterStatus": "Active"
    },

### Cloud Cruiser’s Interface to Azure RateCard API
Cloud Cruiser can use the RateCard API information in different ways. For this article, we show how it can be used to make IaaS workload cost simulation and analysis.

To demonstrate this use case, imagine a workload of several instances running on Microsoft Azure Pack (WAP). The goal is to simulate this same workload on Azure, and estimate the costs of doing such migration. In order to create this simulation, there are two main tasks to be performed:

1. **Import and process the service information collected from the RateCard API.** This task is also performed on the workbooks, where the extract from the RateCard API is transformed and published to a new rate plan. This new rate plan is used on the simulations to estimate the Azure prices.
2. **Normalize WAP services and Azure services for IaaS.** By default, WAP services are based on individual resources (CPU, Memory Size, Disk Size, etc.) while Azure services are based on instance size (A0, A1, A2, etc.). This first task can be performed by Cloud Cruiser’s ETL engine, called workbooks, where these resources can be bundled on instance sizes, analogous to Azure instance services.

### Import data from the RateCard API
Cloud Cruiser workbooks provide an automated way to collect and process information from the RateCard API.  ETL (extract-transform-load) workbooks allow you to configure the collection, transformation, and publishing of data into the Cloud Cruiser database.

Each workbook can have one or multiple collections, allowing you to correlate information from different sources to complement or augment the usage data. The following two screenshots show how to create a new *collection* in an existing workbook, and importing information into the *collection* from the RateCard API:

![Figure 1 - Creating a new collection][1]

![Figure 2 - Import data from the new collection][2]

After importing the data into the workbook, it’s possible to create multiple steps and transformation processes, to modify and model the data. For this example, since we are only interested in infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) we can use the transformation steps to remove unnecessary rows, or records, related to services other than IaaS.

The following screenshot shows the transformation steps used to process the data collected from RateCard API:

![Figure 3 - Transformation steps to process collected data from RateCard API][3]

### Defining New Services and Rate Plans
There are different ways to define services on Cloud Cruiser. One of the options is to import the services from the usage data. This method is commonly used when working with public clouds, where the services are already defined by the provider.

A Rate Plan is a set of rates or prices that can be applied to different services, based on effective dates, or group of customers, among other options. Rate Plans can also be used on Cloud Cruiser to create simulation or “What-if” scenarios, to understand how changes in services can affect the total cost of a workload.

In this example, we use the service information from the RateCard API to define new services in Cloud Cruiser. In the same way, we can use the rates associated to the services to create a new Rate Plan on Cloud Cruiser.

At the end of the transformation process, it is possible to create a new step and publish the data from the RateCard API as new services and rates.

![Figure 4 - Publishing the data from the RateCard API as new Services and Rates][4]

### Verify Azure Services and Rates
After publishing the services and rates, you can verify the list of imported services in Cloud Cruiser’s *Services* tab:

![Figure 5 - Verifying the new Services][5]

On the *Rate Plans* tab, you can check the new rate plan called “AzureSimulation” with the rates imported from the RateCard API.

![Figure 6 - Verifying the new Rate Plan and associated rates][6]

### Normalize WAP and Azure Services
By default, WAP provides usage information based on the use of compute, memory, and network resources. In Cloud Cruiser, you can define your services based directly on the allocation or metered usage of these resources. For example, you can set a basic rate for each hour of CPU usage, or charge the GB of memory allocated to an instance.

For this example, in order to compare costs between WAP and Azure, we need to aggregate the resource usage on WAP into bundles, which can then be mapped to Azure services. This transformation can be implemented easily in the workbooks:

![Figure 7 - Transforming WAP data to normalize services][7]

The last step at the workbook is to publish the data into the Cloud Cruiser database. During this step, the usage data is now bundled into services (that map to the Azure Services) and tied to default rates to create the charges.

After finishing the workbook, you can automate the processing of the data, by adding a task on the scheduler and specifying the frequency and time for the workbook to run.

![Figure 8 - Workbook scheduling][8]

### Create Reports for Workload Cost Simulation Analysis
After the usage is collected and charges are loaded into the Cloud Cruiser database, we can use the Cloud Cruiser Insights module to create the workload cost simulation that we desire.

In order to demonstrate this scenario, we created the following report:

![Cost Comparison][9]

The top graph shows a cost comparison by services, comparing the price of running the workload for each specific service between WAP (dark blue) and Azure (light blue).

The bottom graph shows the same data but broken down by department. The costs for each department to run their workload on WAP and Azure, along with the difference between them is displayed in the Savings bar (green).

## Azure Usage API
### Introduction
Microsoft recently introduced the Azure Usage API, allowing subscribers to programmatically pull in usage data to gain insights into their consumption. Cloud Cruiser customers can take advantage of the richer dataset available through this API.

Cloud Cruiser can use the integration with the Usage API in several ways. The granularity (hourly usage information) and resource metadata information available through the API provides the necessary dataset to support flexible Showback or Chargeback models. 

In this tutorial, we present one example of how Cloud Cruiser can benefit from the Usage API information. More specifically, we will create a Resource Group on Azure, associate tags for the account structure, then describe the process of pulling and processing the tag information into Cloud Cruiser.

The final goal is to be able to create reports like the following one, and be able to analyze cost and consumption based on the account structure populated by the tags.

![Figure 10 - Report with breakdowns using tags][10]

### Microsoft Azure Tags
The data available through the Azure Usage API includes not only consumption information, but also resource metadata including any tags associated with it. Tags provide an easy way to organize your resources, but in order to be effective, you need to ensure that:

* Tags are correctly applied to the resources at provision time
* Tags are properly used on the Showback/Chargeback process to tie the usage to the organization’s account structure.

Both of these requirements can be challenging, especially when there is a manual process on the provision or charging side. Mistyped, incorrect, or even missing tags are common complaints from customers when using tags and these errors can make life on the charging side difficult.

With the new Azure Usage API, Cloud Cruiser can pull resource tagging information, and through a sophisticated ETL tool called workbooks, fix these common tagging errors. Through transformation using regular expressions and data correlation, Cloud Cruiser can identify incorrectly tagged resources and apply the correct tags, ensuring the correct association of the resources with the consumer.

On the charging side, Cloud Cruiser automates the Showback/Chargeback process, and can use the tag information to tie the usage to the appropriate consumer (Department, Division, Project, etc.). This automation provides a huge improvement and can ensure a consistent and auditable charging process.

### Creating a Resource Group with tags on Microsoft Azure
The first step in this tutorial is to create a Resource Group in the Azure portal, then create new tags to associate to the resources. For this example, we be creating the following tags: Department, Environment, Owner, Project.

The following screenshot shows a sample Resource Group with the associated tags.

![Figure 11 - Resource Group with associated tags on Azure portal][11]

The next step is to pull the information from the Usage API into Cloud Cruiser. The Usage API currently provides responses in JSON format. Here is a sample of the data retrieved:

    {
      "id": "/subscriptions/bb678b04-0e48-4b44-XXXX-XXXXXXX/providers/Microsoft.Commerce/UsageAggregates/Daily_BRSDT_20150623_0000",
      "name": "Daily_BRSDT_20150623_0000",
      "type": "Microsoft.Commerce/UsageAggregate",
      "properties":
      {
        "subscriptionId": "bb678b04-0e48-4b44-XXXX-XXXXXXXXX",
        "usageStartTime": "2015-06-22T00:00:00+00:00",
        "usageEndTime": "2015-06-23T00:00:00+00:00",
        "meterName": "Compute Hours",
        "meterRegion": "",
        "meterCategory": "Virtual Machines",
        "meterSubCategory": "Standard_D1 VM (Non-Windows)",
        "unit": "Hours",
        "instanceData": "{\"Microsoft.Resources\":{\"resourceUri\":\"/subscriptions/bb678b04-0e48-4b44-XXXX-XXXXXXXX/resourceGroups/DEMOUSAGEAPI/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/MyDockerVM\",\"location\":\"eastus\",\"tags\":{\"Department\":\"Sales\",\"Project\":\"Demo Usage API\",\"Environment\":\"Test\",\"Owner\":\"RSE\"},\"additionalInfo\":{\"ImageType\":\"Canonical\",\"ServiceType\":\"Standard_D1\"}}}",
        "meterId": "e60caf26-9ba0-413d-a422-6141f58081d6",
        "infoFields": {},
        "quantity": 8

      },
    },


### Import data from the Usage API into Cloud Cruiser
Cloud Cruiser workbooks provide an automated way to collect and process information from the Usage API. An ETL (extract-transform-load) workbook allows you to configure the collection, transformation, and publishing of data into the Cloud Cruiser database.

Each workbook can have one or multiple collections. This allows you to correlate information from different sources to complement or augment the usage data. For this example, we create a new sheet in the Azure template workbook (*UsageAPI)* and set a new *collection* to import information from the Usage API.

![Figure 3 - Usage API data imported into the UsageAPI sheet][12]

Notice that this workbook already has other sheets to import services from Azure (*ImportServices*), and process the consumption information from the Billing API (*PublishData*).

Next, we use the Usage API to populate the *UsageAPI* sheet, and correlate the information with the consumption data from the Billing API on the *PublishData* sheet.

### Processing the tag information from the Usage API
After importing the data into the workbook, we create transformation steps in the *UsageAPI* sheet in order to process the information from the API. First step is to use a “JSON split” processor to extract the tags from a single field, then create fields for each one of them (Department, Project, Owner, and Environment).

![Figure 4 - Create new fields for the tag information][13]

Notice the “Networking” service is missing the tag information (yellow box), but we can verify that it is part of the same Resource Group by looking at the *ResourceGroupName* field. Since we have the tags for the other resources from this Resource Group, we can use this information to apply the missing tags to this resource later in the process.

The next step is to create a lookup table associating the information from the tags to the *ResourceGroupName*. This lookup table is used on the next step to enrich the consumption data with tag information.

### Adding the tag information to the consumption data
Now we can jump to the *PublishData* sheet, which processes the consumption information from the Billing API, and add the fields extracted from the tags. This process is performed by looking at the lookup table created on the previous step, using the *ResourceGroupName*
as the key for the lookups.

![Figure 5 - Populating the account structure with the information from the lookups][14]

Notice that the appropriate account structure fields for the “Networking” service were applied, fixing the issue with the missing tags. We also populated the account structure fields for resources other than our target Resource Group with “Other”, in order to differentiate them on the reports.

Now we just need to add a step to publish the usage data. During this step, the appropriate rates for each service defined on our Rate Plan be applied to the usage information, with the resulting charge loaded into the database.

The best part is that you only have to go through this process once. When the workbook is completed, you just need to add it to the scheduler and it runs hourly or daily at the scheduled time. Then it’s just a matter of creating new reports, or customizing existing ones, in order to analyze the data to get meaningful insights from your cloud usage.
