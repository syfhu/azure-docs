# Link partner ID to your Azure accounts

As a partner, you can track your impact across your customer engagements by linking your partner ID to the accounts used for managing customer's resources.

This feature is available in a public preview.

## Get access from your customer

Before you link your partner ID, your customer must give you access to their Azure resources by using one of the following options:

- **Guest user:** Your customer can add you as a guest user and assign any RBAC roles. For more information, see [Add guest users from another directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-b2b-what-is-azure-ad-b2b).

- **Directory account:**  Your customer can create a new user from your organization in their directory and assign any RBAC role.

- **Service principal:**  Your customer can add an app or script from your organization in their directory and assign any RBAC role. The identity of the app or script is known as service principal.

## Link partner ID

When you have access to the customer's resources, use Azure portal, PowerShell, or CLI to link your Microsoft Partner Network ID (MPN ID) to your user ID or service principal. You have to link the partner ID in each customer tenant.

### Use Azure portal to link new partner ID
