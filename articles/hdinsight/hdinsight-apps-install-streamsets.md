# Install published application - StreamSets Data Collector

This article describes how to install and run the [StreamSets Data Collector for HDInsight](https://streamsets.com/) published Hadoop application on Azure HDInsight. For an overview of the HDInsight application platform, and a list of available Independent Software Vendor (ISV) published applications, see [Install third-party Hadoop applications](hdinsight-apps-install-applications.md). For instructions on installing your own application, see [Install custom HDInsight applications](hdinsight-apps-install-custom-applications.md).

## About StreamSets Data Collector

The StreamSets Data Collector deploys on top of an Azure HDInsight application. StreamSets Data Collector provides a full-featured integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you design, test, deploy, and manage any-to-any ingest pipelines. These pipelines can mesh stream and batch data, and include a variety of in-stream transformations, all without having to write custom code.

StreamSets Data Collector lets you build data flows using numerous Big Data components such as HDFS, Kafka, Solr, Hive, HBASE, and Kudu. Once StreamSets Data Collector is running on an edge server, or in your Hadoop cluster, you get real-time monitoring for both data anomalies and data flow operations. This monitoring includes threshold-based alerting, anomaly detection, and automatic remediation of error records.

StreamSets Data Collector is designed to logically isolate each stage in a pipeline, so you can meet new business requirements by dropping in new processors and connectors without coding and with minimal downtime.
