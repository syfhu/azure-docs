# Run Pig jobs from a Remote Desktop connection
[!INCLUDE [pig-selector](../../../includes/hdinsight-selector-use-pig.md)]

This document provides a walkthrough for using the Pig command to run Pig Latin statements from a Remote Desktop connection to a Windows-based HDInsight cluster. Pig Latin allows you to create MapReduce applications by describing data transformations, rather than map and reduce functions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remote Desktop is only available on HDInsight clusters that use Windows as the operating system. Linux is the only operating system used on HDInsight version 3.4 or greater. For more information, see [HDInsight retirement on Windows](../hdinsight-component-versioning.md#hdinsight-windows-retirement).
>
> For HDInsight 3.4 or greater, see [Use Pig with HDInsight and SSH](apache-hadoop-use-pig-ssh.md) for information on interactively running Pig jobs directly on the cluster from a command-line.

## <a id="prereq"></a>Prerequisites
To complete the steps in this article, you will need the following.

* A Windows-based HDInsight (Hadoop on HDInsight) cluster
* A client computer running Windows 10, Windows 8, or Windows 7

## <a id="connect"></a>Connect with Remote Desktop
Enable Remote Desktop for the HDInsight cluster, then connect to it by following the instructions at [Connect to HDInsight clusters using RDP](../hdinsight-administer-use-management-portal.md#connect-to-clusters-using-rdp).

## <a id="pig"></a>Use the Pig command
1. After you have a Remote Desktop connection, start the **Hadoop Command Line** by using the icon on the desktop.
2. Use the following to start the Pig command:

        %pig_home%\bin\pig

    You will be presented with a `grunt>` prompt.
3. Enter the following statement:

        LOGS = LOAD 'wasb:///example/data/sample.log';

    This command loads the contents of the sample.log file into the LOGS file. You can view the contents of the file by using the following command:

        DUMP LOGS;
4. Transform the data by applying a regular expression to extract only the logging level from each record:

        LEVELS = foreach LOGS generate REGEX_EXTRACT($0, '(TRACE|DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR|FATAL)', 1)  as LOGLEVEL;

    You can use **DUMP** to view the data after the transformation. In this case, `DUMP LEVELS;`.
5. Continue applying transformations by using the following statements. Use `DUMP` to view the result of the transformation after each step.

    <table>
    <tr>
    <th>Statement</th><th>What it does</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>FILTEREDLEVELS = FILTER LEVELS by LOGLEVEL is not null;</td><td>Removes rows that contain a null value for the log level and stores the results into FILTEREDLEVELS.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>GROUPEDLEVELS = GROUP FILTEREDLEVELS by LOGLEVEL;</td><td>Groups the rows by log level and stores the results into GROUPEDLEVELS.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>FREQUENCIES = foreach GROUPEDLEVELS generate group as LOGLEVEL, COUNT(FILTEREDLEVELS.LOGLEVEL) as COUNT;</td><td>Creates a new set of data that contains each unique log level value and how many times it occurs. This is stored into FREQUENCIES</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>RESULT = order FREQUENCIES by COUNT desc;</td><td>Orders the log levels by count (descending,) and stores into RESULT</td>
    </tr>
</table>

6. You can also save the results of a transformation by using the `STORE` statement. For example, the following command saves the `RESULT` to the **/example/data/pigout** directory in the default storage container for your cluster:

        STORE RESULT into 'wasb:///example/data/pigout'

   > [!NOTE]
   > The data is stored in the specified directory in files named **part-nnnnn**. If the directory already exists, you will receive an error message.
   >
   >
   
7. To exit the grunt prompt, enter the following statement.

        QUIT;

### Pig Latin batch files
You can also use the Pig command to run Pig Latin that is contained in a file.

1. After exiting the grunt prompt, open **Notepad** and create a new file named **pigbatch.pig** in the **%PIG_HOME%** directory.
2. Type or paste the following lines into the **pigbatch.pig** file, and then save it:

        LOGS = LOAD 'wasb:///example/data/sample.log';
        LEVELS = foreach LOGS generate REGEX_EXTRACT($0, '(TRACE|DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR|FATAL)', 1)  as LOGLEVEL;
        FILTEREDLEVELS = FILTER LEVELS by LOGLEVEL is not null;
        GROUPEDLEVELS = GROUP FILTEREDLEVELS by LOGLEVEL;
        FREQUENCIES = foreach GROUPEDLEVELS generate group as LOGLEVEL, COUNT(FILTEREDLEVELS.LOGLEVEL) as COUNT;
        RESULT = order FREQUENCIES by COUNT desc;
        DUMP RESULT;
3. Use the following to run the **pigbatch.pig** file using the pig command.

        pig %PIG_HOME%\pigbatch.pig

    When the batch job completes, you should see the following output, which should be the same as when you used `DUMP RESULT;` in the previous steps:

        (TRACE,816)
        (DEBUG,434)
        (INFO,96)
        (WARN,11)
        (ERROR,6)
        (FATAL,2)

## <a id="summary"></a>Summary
As you can see, the Pig command allows you to interactively run MapReduce operations, or run Pig Latin jobs that are stored in a batch file.
