# Use Python User Defined Functions (UDF) with Hive and Pig in HDInsight

Learn how to use Python user-defined functions (UDF) with Apache Hive and Pig in Hadoop on Azure HDInsight.

## <a name="python"></a>Python on HDInsight

Python2.7 is installed by default on HDInsight 3.0 and later. Apache Hive can be used with this version of Python for stream processing. Stream processing uses STDOUT and STDIN to pass data between Hive and the UDF.

HDInsight also includes Jython, which is a Python implementation written in Java. Jython runs directly on the Java Virtual Machine and does not use streaming. Jython is the recommended Python interpreter when using Python with Pig.

> [!WARNING]
> The steps in this document make the following assumptions: 
>
> * You create the Python scripts on your local development environment.
> * You upload the scripts to HDInsight using either the `scp` command from a local Bash session or the provided PowerShell script.
>
> If you want to use the [Azure Cloud Shell (bash)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview) preview to work with HDInsight, then you must:
>
> * Create the scripts inside the cloud shell environment.
> * Use `scp` to upload the files from the cloud shell to HDInsight.
> * Use `ssh` from the cloud shell to connect to HDInsight and run the examples.

## <a name="hivepython"></a>Hive UDF

Python can be used as a UDF from Hive through the HiveQL `TRANSFORM` statement. For example, the following HiveQL invokes the `hiveudf.py` file stored in the default Azure Storage account for the cluster.

**Linux-based HDInsight**

```hiveql
add file wasb:///hiveudf.py;

SELECT TRANSFORM (clientid, devicemake, devicemodel)
    USING 'python hiveudf.py' AS
    (clientid string, phoneLable string, phoneHash string)
FROM hivesampletable
ORDER BY clientid LIMIT 50;
```

**Windows-based HDInsight**

```hiveql
add file wasb:///hiveudf.py;

SELECT TRANSFORM (clientid, devicemake, devicemodel)
    USING 'D:\Python27\python.exe hiveudf.py' AS
    (clientid string, phoneLable string, phoneHash string)
FROM hivesampletable
ORDER BY clientid LIMIT 50;
```

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows-based HDInsight clusters, the `USING` clause must specify the full path to python.exe.

Here's what this example does:

1. The `add file` statement at the beginning of the file adds the `hiveudf.py` file to the distributed cache, so it's accessible by all nodes in the cluster.
2. The `SELECT TRANSFORM ... USING` statement selects data from the `hivesampletable`. It also passes the clientid, devicemake, and devicemodel values to the `hiveudf.py` script.
3. The `AS` clause describes the fields returned from `hiveudf.py`.

<a name="streamingpy"></a>

### Create the hiveudf.py file


On your development environment, create a text file named `hiveudf.py`. Use the following code as the contents of the file:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
import string
import hashlib

while True:
    line = sys.stdin.readline()
    if not line:
        break

    line = string.strip(line, "\n ")
    clientid, devicemake, devicemodel = string.split(line, "\t")
    phone_label = devicemake + ' ' + devicemodel
    print "\t".join([clientid, phone_label, hashlib.md5(phone_label).hexdigest()])
```

This script performs the following actions:

1. Read a line of data from STDIN.
2. The trailing newline character is removed using `string.strip(line, "\n ")`.
3. When doing stream processing, a single line contains all the values with a tab character between each value. So `string.split(line, "\t")` can be used to split the input at each tab, returning just the fields.
4. When processing is complete, the output must be written to STDOUT as a single line, with a tab between each field. For example, `print "\t".join([clientid, phone_label, hashlib.md5(phone_label).hexdigest()])`.
5. The `while` loop repeats until no `line` is read.

The script output is a concatenation of the input values for `devicemake` and `devicemodel`, and a hash of the concatenated value.

See [Running the examples](#running) for how to run this example on your HDInsight cluster.

## <a name="pigpython"></a>Pig UDF

A Python script can be used as a UDF from Pig through the `GENERATE` statement. You can run the script using either Jython or C Python.

* Jython runs on the JVM, and can natively be called from Pig.
* C Python is an external process, so the data from Pig on the JVM is sent out to the script running in a Python process. The output of the Python script is sent back into Pig.

To specify the Python interpreter, use `register` when referencing the Python script. The following examples register scripts with Pig as `myfuncs`:

* **To use Jython**: `register '/path/to/pigudf.py' using jython as myfuncs;`
* **To use C Python**: `register '/path/to/pigudf.py' using streaming_python as myfuncs;`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using Jython, the path to the pig_jython file can be either a local path or a WASB:// path. However, when using C Python, you must reference a file on the local file system of the node that you are using to submit the Pig job.

Once past registration, the Pig Latin for this example is the same for both:

```pig
LOGS = LOAD 'wasb:///example/data/sample.log' as (LINE:chararray);
LOG = FILTER LOGS by LINE is not null;
DETAILS = FOREACH LOG GENERATE myfuncs.create_structure(LINE);
DUMP DETAILS;
```

Here's what this example does:

1. The first line loads the sample data file, `sample.log` into `LOGS`. It also defines each record as a `chararray`.
2. The next line filters out any null values, storing the result of the operation into `LOG`.
3. Next, it iterates over the records in `LOG` and uses `GENERATE` to invoke the `create_structure` method contained in the Python/Jython script loaded as `myfuncs`. `LINE` is used to pass the current record to the function.
4. Finally, the outputs are dumped to STDOUT using the `DUMP` command. This command displays the results after the operation completes.

### Create the pigudf.py file

On your development environment, create a text file named `pigudf.py`. Use the following code as the contents of the file:

<a name="streamingpy"></a>

```python
# Uncomment the following if using C Python
#from pig_util import outputSchema

@outputSchema("log: {(date:chararray, time:chararray, classname:chararray, level:chararray, detail:chararray)}")
def create_structure(input):
    if (input.startswith('java.lang.Exception')):
        input = input[21:len(input)] + ' - java.lang.Exception'
    date, time, classname, level, detail = input.split(' ', 4)
    return date, time, classname, level, detail
```

In the Pig Latin example, the `LINE` input is defined as a chararray because there is no consistent schema for the input. The Python script transforms the data into a consistent schema for output.

1. The `@outputSchema` statement defines the format of the data that is returned to Pig. In this case, it's a **data bag**, which is a Pig data type. The bag contains the following fields, all of which are chararray (strings):

   * date - the date the log entry was created
   * time - the time the log entry was created
   * classname - the class name the entry was created for
   * level - the log level
   * detail - verbose details for the log entry

2. Next, the `def create_structure(input)` defines the function that Pig passes line items to.

3. The example data, `sample.log`, mostly conforms to the date, time, classname, level, and detail schema. However, it contains a few lines that begin with `*java.lang.Exception*`. These lines must be modified to match the schema. The `if` statement checks for those, then massages the input data to move the `*java.lang.Exception*` string to the end, bringing the data in-line with the expected output schema.

4. Next, the `split` command is used to split the data at the first four space characters. The output is assigned into `date`, `time`, `classname`, `level`, and `detail`.

5. Finally, the values are returned to Pig.

When the data is returned to Pig, it has a consistent schema as defined in the `@outputSchema` statement.

## <a name="running"></a>Upload and run the examples

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **SSH** steps only work with a Linux-based HDInsight cluster. The **PowerShell** steps work with either a Linux or Windows-based HDInsight cluster, but require a Windows client.

### SSH

For more information on using SSH, see [Use SSH with HDInsight](../hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md).

1. Use `scp` to copy the files to your HDInsight cluster. For example, the following command copies the files to a cluster named **mycluster**.

    ```bash
    scp hiveudf.py pigudf.py myuser@mycluster-ssh.azurehdinsight.net:
    ```

2. Use SSH to connect to the cluster.

    ```bash
    ssh myuser@mycluster-ssh.azurehdinsight.net
    ```

    For more information, see the [Use SSH with HDInsight](../hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md) document.

3. From the SSH session, add the python files uploaded previously to the WASB storage for the cluster.

    ```bash
    hdfs dfs -put hiveudf.py /hiveudf.py
    hdfs dfs -put pigudf.py /pigudf.py
    ```

After uploading the files, use the following steps to run the Hive and Pig jobs.

#### Use the Hive UDF

1. To connect to Hive, use the following command:

    ```bash
    beeline -u 'jdbc:hive2://headnodehost:10001/;transportMode=http'
    ```

    This command starts the Beeline client.

2. Enter the following query at the `0: jdbc:hive2://headnodehost:10001/>` prompt:

   ```hive
   add file wasb:///hiveudf.py;
   SELECT TRANSFORM (clientid, devicemake, devicemodel)
       USING 'python hiveudf.py' AS
       (clientid string, phoneLabel string, phoneHash string)
   FROM hivesampletable
   ORDER BY clientid LIMIT 50;
   ```

3. After entering the last line, the job should start. Once the job completes, it returns output similar to the following example:

        100041    RIM 9650    d476f3687700442549a83fac4560c51c
        100041    RIM 9650    d476f3687700442549a83fac4560c51c
        100042    Apple iPhone 4.2.x    375ad9a0ddc4351536804f1d5d0ea9b9
        100042    Apple iPhone 4.2.x    375ad9a0ddc4351536804f1d5d0ea9b9
        100042    Apple iPhone 4.2.x    375ad9a0ddc4351536804f1d5d0ea9b9

4. To exit Beeline, use the following command:

    ```hive
    !q
    ```

#### Use the Pig UDF

1. To connect to pig, use the following command:

    ```bash
    pig
    ```

2. Enter the following statements at the `grunt>` prompt:

   ```pig
   Register wasb:///pigudf.py using jython as myfuncs;
   LOGS = LOAD 'wasb:///example/data/sample.log' as (LINE:chararray);
   LOG = FILTER LOGS by LINE is not null;
   DETAILS = foreach LOG generate myfuncs.create_structure(LINE);
   DUMP DETAILS;
   ```

3. After entering the following line, the job should start. Once the job completes, it returns output similar to the following data:

        ((2012-02-03,20:11:56,SampleClass5,[TRACE],verbose detail for id 990982084))
        ((2012-02-03,20:11:56,SampleClass7,[TRACE],verbose detail for id 1560323914))
        ((2012-02-03,20:11:56,SampleClass8,[DEBUG],detail for id 2083681507))
        ((2012-02-03,20:11:56,SampleClass3,[TRACE],verbose detail for id 1718828806))
        ((2012-02-03,20:11:56,SampleClass3,[INFO],everything normal for id 530537821))

4. Use `quit` to exit the Grunt shell, and then use the following to edit the pigudf.py file on the local file system:

    ```bash
    nano pigudf.py
    ```

5. Once in the editor, uncomment the following line by removing the `#` character from the beginning of the line:

    ```bash
    #from pig_util import outputSchema
    ```

    This line modifies the Python script to work with C Python instead of Jython. Once the change has been made, use **Ctrl+X** to exit the editor. Select **Y**, and then **Enter** to save the changes.

6. Use the `pig` command to start the shell again. Once you are at the `grunt>` prompt, use the following to run the Python script using the C Python interpreter.

   ```pig
   Register 'pigudf.py' using streaming_python as myfuncs;
   LOGS = LOAD 'wasb:///example/data/sample.log' as (LINE:chararray);
   LOG = FILTER LOGS by LINE is not null;
   DETAILS = foreach LOG generate myfuncs.create_structure(LINE);
   DUMP DETAILS;
   ```

    Once this job completes, you should see the same output as when you previously ran the script using Jython.

### PowerShell: Upload the files

You can use PowerShell to upload the files to the HDInsight server. Use the following script to upload the Python files:

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The steps in this section use Azure PowerShell. For more information on using Azure PowerShell, see [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/overview).

[!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/hdinsight/run-python-udf/run-python-udf.ps1?range=5-41)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Change the `C:\path\to` value to the path to the files on your development environment.

This script retrieves information for your HDInsight cluster, then extracts the account and key for the default storage account, and uploads the files to the root of the container.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on uploading files, see the [Upload data for Hadoop jobs in HDInsight](../hdinsight-upload-data.md) document.

#### PowerShell: Use the Hive UDF

PowerShell can also be used to remotely run Hive queries. Use the following PowerShell script to run a Hive query that uses **hiveudf.py** script:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before running, the script prompts you for the HTTPs/Admin account information for your HDInsight cluster.

[!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/hdinsight/run-python-udf/run-python-udf.ps1?range=45-94)]

The output for the **Hive** job should appear similar to the following example:

    100041    RIM 9650    d476f3687700442549a83fac4560c51c
    100041    RIM 9650    d476f3687700442549a83fac4560c51c
    100042    Apple iPhone 4.2.x    375ad9a0ddc4351536804f1d5d0ea9b9
    100042    Apple iPhone 4.2.x    375ad9a0ddc4351536804f1d5d0ea9b9
    100042    Apple iPhone 4.2.x    375ad9a0ddc4351536804f1d5d0ea9b9

#### Pig (Jython)

PowerShell can also be used to run Pig Latin jobs. To run a Pig Latin job that uses the **pigudf.py** script, use the following PowerShell script:

> [!NOTE]
> When remotely submitting a job using PowerShell, it is not possible to use C Python as the interpreter.

[!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/hdinsight/run-python-udf/run-python-udf.ps1?range=98-144)]

The output for the **Pig** job should appear similar to the following data:

    ((2012-02-03,20:11:56,SampleClass5,[TRACE],verbose detail for id 990982084))
    ((2012-02-03,20:11:56,SampleClass7,[TRACE],verbose detail for id 1560323914))
    ((2012-02-03,20:11:56,SampleClass8,[DEBUG],detail for id 2083681507))
    ((2012-02-03,20:11:56,SampleClass3,[TRACE],verbose detail for id 1718828806))
    ((2012-02-03,20:11:56,SampleClass3,[INFO],everything normal for id 530537821))

## <a name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting

### Errors when running jobs

When running the hive job, you may encounter an error similar to the following text:

    Caused by: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: [Error 20001]: An error occurred while reading or writing to your custom script. It may have crashed with an error.

This problem may be caused by the line endings in the Python file. Many Windows editors default to using CRLF as the line ending, but Linux applications usually expect LF.

You can use the following PowerShell statements to remove the CR characters before uploading the file to HDInsight:

[!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/hdinsight/run-python-udf/run-python-udf.ps1?range=148-150)]

### PowerShell scripts

Both of the example PowerShell scripts used to run the examples contain a commented line that displays error output for the job. If you are not seeing the expected output for the job, uncomment the following line and see if the error information indicates a problem.

[!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/hdinsight/run-python-udf/run-python-udf.ps1?range=135-139)]

The error information (STDERR) and the result of the job (STDOUT) are also logged to your HDInsight storage.

| For this job... | Look at these files in the blob container |
| --- | --- |
| Hive |/HivePython/stderr<p>/HivePython/stdout |
| Pig |/PigPython/stderr<p>/PigPython/stdout |
