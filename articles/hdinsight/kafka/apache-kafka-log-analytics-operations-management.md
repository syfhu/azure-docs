# Analyze logs for Apache Kafka on HDInsight

Learn how to use Log Analytics to analyze logs generated by Apache Kafka on HDInsight.

## Enable Log Analytics for Kafka

The steps to enable Log Analytics for HDInsight are the same for all HDInsight clusters. Use the following links to understand how to create and configure the required services:

1. Create a Log Analytics workspace. For more information, see the [Get started with a Log Analytics workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics) document.

2. Create a Kafka on HDInsight cluster. For more information, see the [Start with Apache Kafka on HDInsight](apache-kafka-get-started.md) document.

3. Configure the Kafka cluster to use Log Analytics. For more information, see the [Use Log Analytics to monitor HDInsight](../hdinsight-hadoop-oms-log-analytics-tutorial.md) document.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also configure the cluster to use Log Analytics by using the `Enable-AzureRmHDInsightOperationsManagementSuite` cmdlet. This cmdlet requires the following information:
    >
    > * The HDInsight cluster name.
    > * The workspace ID for Log Analytics. You can find the workspace ID in your Log Analytics workspace.
    > * The primary key for the Log Analytics connection. To find the primary key, open the workspace in the Azure portal, select __Advanced settings__ from the left menu. From Advanced settings, select  __Connected Sources__>__Linux Servers__.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> It may take around 20 minutes before data is available for Log Analytics.

## Query logs

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select your Log Analytics workspace.

2. Select __Log Search__. From here, you can search the data collected from Kafka. The following are some example searches:

    * Disk usage: `Perf | where ObjectName == "Logical Disk" and CounterName == "Free Megabytes" and InstanceName == "_Total" and ((Computer startswith_cs "hn" and Computer contains_cs "-") or (Computer startswith_cs "wn" and Computer contains_cs "-")) | summarize AggregatedValue = avg(CounterValue) by Computer, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)`

    * CPU usage: `Perf | where CounterName == "% Processor Time" and InstanceName == "_Total" and ((Computer startswith_cs "hn" and Computer contains_cs "-") or (Computer startswith_cs "wn" and Computer contains_cs "-")) | summarize AggregatedValue = avg(CounterValue) by Computer, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)`

    * Incoming messages per second: `metrics_kafka_CL | where ClusterName_s == "your_kafka_cluster_name" and InstanceName_s == "kafka-BrokerTopicMetrics-MessagesInPerSec-Count" | summarize AggregatedValue = avg(kafka_BrokerTopicMetrics_MessagesInPerSec_Count_value_d) by HostName_s, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)`

    * Incoming bytes per second: `metrics_kafka_CL | where HostName_s == "wn0-kafka" and InstanceName_s == "kafka-BrokerTopicMetrics-BytesInPerSec-Count" | summarize AggregatedValue = avg(kafka_BrokerTopicMetrics_BytesInPerSec_Count_value_d) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)`

    * Outgoing bytes per second: `metrics_kafka_CL | where ClusterName_s == "your_kafka_cluster_name" and InstanceName_s == "kafka-BrokerTopicMetrics-BytesOutPerSec-Count" | summarize AggregatedValue = avg(kafka_BrokerTopicMetrics_BytesOutPerSec_Count_value_d) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)`

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Replace the query values with your cluster specific information. For example, `ClusterName_s` must be set to the name of your cluster. `HostName_s` must be set to the domain name of a worker node in the cluster.

    You can also enter `*` to search all types logged. Currently the following logs are available for queries:

    | Log type | Description |
    | ---- | ---- |
    | log\_kafkaserver\_CL | Kafka broker server.log |
    | log\_kafkacontroller\_CL | Kafka broker controller.log |
    | metrics\_kafka\_CL | Kafka JMX metrics |
