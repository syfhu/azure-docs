# Use Oozie with Hadoop to define and run a workflow on Linux-based Azure HDInsight

[!INCLUDE [oozie-selector](../../includes/hdinsight-oozie-selector.md)]

Learn how to use Apache Oozie with Hadoop on Azure HDInsight. Oozie is a workflow and coordination system that manages Hadoop jobs. Oozie is integrated with the Hadoop stack, and it supports the following jobs:

* Apache MapReduce
* Apache Pig
* Apache Hive
* Apache Sqoop

You can also use Oozie to schedule jobs that are specific to a system, like Java programs or shell scripts.

> [!NOTE]
> Another option to define workflows with HDInsight is to use Azure Data Factory. To learn more about Data Factory, see [Use Pig and Hive with Data Factory][azure-data-factory-pig-hive].


## Prerequisites

* **An HDInsight cluster**: See [Get Started with HDInsight on Linux](/hadoop/apache-hadoop-linux-tutorial-get-started.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The steps in this document require an HDInsight cluster that uses Linux. Linux is the only operating system used on HDInsight version 3.4 or later. For more information, see [HDInsight retirement on Windows](hdinsight-component-versioning.md#hdinsight-windows-retirement).

## Example workflow

The workflow used in this document contains two actions. Actions are definitions for tasks, such as running Hive, Sqoop, MapReduce, or other processes:

![Workflow diagram][img-workflow-diagram]

1. A Hive action runs an HiveQL script to extract records from the **hivesampletable** that's included with HDInsight. Each row of data describes a visit from a specific mobile device. The record format appears like the following text:

        8       18:54:20        en-US   Android Samsung SCH-i500        California     United States    13.9204007      0       0
        23      19:19:44        en-US   Android HTC     Incredible      Pennsylvania   United States    NULL    0       0
        23      19:19:46        en-US   Android HTC     Incredible      Pennsylvania   United States    1.4757422       0       1

    The Hive script used in this document counts the total visits for each platform, such as Android or iPhone, and stores the counts to a new Hive table.

    For more information about Hive, see [Use Hive with HDInsight][hdinsight-use-hive].

2. A Sqoop action exports the contents of the new Hive table to a table created in Azure SQL Database. For more information about Sqoop, see [Use Hadoop Sqoop with HDInsight][hdinsight-use-sqoop].

> [!NOTE]
> For supported Oozie versions on HDInsight clusters, see [What's new in the Hadoop cluster versions provided by HDInsight][hdinsight-versions].

## Create the working directory

Oozie expects you to store all the resources required for a job in the same directory. This example uses **wasb:///tutorials/useoozie**. To create this directory, complete the following steps:

1. Connect to the HDInsight cluster by using SSH:

    ```bash
    ssh sshuser@clustername-ssh.azurehdinsight.net
    ```

    Replace `sshuser` with the SSH user name for the cluster. Replace `clustername` with the name of the cluster. For more information, see [Use SSH with HDInsight](hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md).

2. To create the directory, use the following command:

    ```bash
    hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /tutorials/useoozie/data
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `-p` parameter causes the creation of all directories in the path. The **data** directory is used to hold the data used by the **useooziewf.hql** script.

3. To make sure that Oozie can impersonate your user account, use the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo adduser username users
    ```

    Replace `username` with your SSH user name.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can ignore errors that indicate the user is already a member of the `users` group.

## Add a database driver

Because this workflow uses Sqoop to export data to the SQL database, you must provide a copy of the JDBC driver used to interact with the SQL database. To copy the JDBC driver to the working directory, use the following command from the SSH session:

```bash
hdfs dfs -put /usr/share/java/sqljdbc_4.1/enu/sqljdbc*.jar /tutorials/useoozie/
```

> [!NOTE]
> You may receive a message that the file already exists.

If your workflow used other resources, such as a jar that contains a MapReduce application, you need to add those resources as well.

## Define the Hive query

Use the following steps to create a Hive query language (HiveQL) script that defines a query. You will use the query in an Oozie workflow later in this document.

1. From the SSH connection, use the following command to create a file named `useooziewf.hql`:

    ```bash
    nano useooziewf.hql
    ```

3. After the GNU nano editor opens, use the following query as the contents of the file:

    ```hiveql
    DROP TABLE ${hiveTableName};
    CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ${hiveTableName}(deviceplatform string, count string) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' STORED AS TEXTFILE LOCATION '${hiveDataFolder}';
    INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE ${hiveTableName} SELECT deviceplatform, COUNT(*) as count FROM hivesampletable GROUP BY deviceplatform;
    ```

    There are two variables used in the script:

    * `${hiveTableName}`: Contains the name of the table to be created.

    * `${hiveDataFolder}`: Contains the location to store the data files for the table.

    The workflow definition file, workflow.xml in this tutorial, passes these values to this HiveQL script at runtime.

4. To exit the editor, select Ctrl+X. When prompted, select `Y` to save the file, enter `useooziewf.hql` as the file name, and then select **Enter**.

5. Use the following commands to copy `useooziewf.hql` to `wasb:///tutorials/useoozie/useooziewf.hql`:

    ```bash
    hdfs dfs -put useooziewf.hql /tutorials/useoozie/useooziewf.hql
    ```

    This command stores the `useooziewf.hql` file in the HDFS-compatible storage for the cluster.

## Define the workflow

Oozie workflow definitions are written in Hadoop Process Definition Language (hPDL), which is an XML process definition language. Use the following steps to define the workflow:

1. Use the following statement to create and edit a new file:

    ```bash
    nano workflow.xml
    ```

2. After the nano editor opens, enter the following XML as the file contents:

    ```xml
    <workflow-app name="useooziewf" xmlns="uri:oozie:workflow:0.2">
        <start to = "RunHiveScript"/>
        <action name="RunHiveScript">
        <hive xmlns="uri:oozie:hive-action:0.2">
            <job-tracker>${jobTracker}</job-tracker>
            <name-node>${nameNode}</name-node>
            <configuration>
            <property>
                <name>mapred.job.queue.name</name>
                <value>${queueName}</value>
            </property>
            </configuration>
            <script>${hiveScript}</script>
            <param>hiveTableName=${hiveTableName}</param>
            <param>hiveDataFolder=${hiveDataFolder}</param>
        </hive>
        <ok to="RunSqoopExport"/>
        <error to="fail"/>
        </action>
        <action name="RunSqoopExport">
        <sqoop xmlns="uri:oozie:sqoop-action:0.2">
            <job-tracker>${jobTracker}</job-tracker>
            <name-node>${nameNode}</name-node>
            <configuration>
            <property>
                <name>mapred.compress.map.output</name>
                <value>true</value>
            </property>
            </configuration>
            <arg>export</arg>
            <arg>--connect</arg>
            <arg>${sqlDatabaseConnectionString}</arg>
            <arg>--table</arg>
            <arg>${sqlDatabaseTableName}</arg>
            <arg>--export-dir</arg>
            <arg>${hiveDataFolder}</arg>
            <arg>-m</arg>
            <arg>1</arg>
            <arg>--input-fields-terminated-by</arg>
            <arg>"\t"</arg>
            <archive>sqljdbc41.jar</archive>
            </sqoop>
        <ok to="end"/>
        <error to="fail"/>
        </action>
        <kill name="fail">
        <message>Job failed, error message[${wf:errorMessage(wf:lastErrorNode())}] </message>
        </kill>
        <end name="end"/>
    </workflow-app>
    ```

    There are two actions defined in the workflow:

   * `RunHiveScript`: This action is the start action and runs the `useooziewf.hql` Hive script.

   * `RunSqoopExport`: This action exports the data created from the Hive script to a SQL database by using Sqoop. This action only runs if the `RunHiveScript` action is successful.

     The workflow has several entries, such as `${jobTracker}`. You will replace these entries with the values you use in the job definition. You will create the job definition later in this document.

     Also note the `<archive>sqljdbc4.jar</archive>` entry in the Sqoop section. This entry instructs Oozie to make this archive available for Sqoop when this action runs.

3. To save the file, select Ctrl+X, enter `Y`, and then select **Enter**. 

4. Use the following command to copy the `workflow.xml` file to `/tutorials/useoozie/workflow.xml`:

    ```bash
    hdfs dfs -put workflow.xml /tutorials/useoozie/workflow.xml
    ```

## Create the database

To create a SQL database, follow the steps in the [Create a SQL database](../sql-database/sql-database-get-started.md) document. When you create the database, use `oozietest` as the database name. Also make a note of the name of the database server.

### Create the table

> [!NOTE]
> There are many ways to connect to SQL Database to create a table. The following steps use [FreeTDS](http://www.freetds.org/) from the HDInsight cluster.


1. Use the following command to install FreeTDS on the HDInsight cluster:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get --assume-yes install freetds-dev freetds-bin
    ```

2. After FreeTDS has been installed, use the following command to connect to the SQL database server you created previously:

    ```bash
    TDSVER=8.0 tsql -H <serverName>.database.windows.net -U <sqlLogin> -P <sqlPassword> -p 1433 -D oozietest
    ```

    You receive output like the following text:

        locale is "en_US.UTF-8"
        locale charset is "UTF-8"
        using default charset "UTF-8"
        Default database being set to oozietest
        1>

3. At the `1>` prompt, enter the following lines:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[mobiledata](
    [deviceplatform] [nvarchar](50),
    [count] [bigint])
    GO
    CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX mobiledata_clustered_index on mobiledata(deviceplatform)
    GO
    ```

    When the `GO` statement is entered, the previous statements are evaluated. These statements create a table, named **mobiledata**, that's used by the workflow.

    To verify that the table has been created, use the following commands:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables
    GO
    ```

    You see output like the following text:

        TABLE_CATALOG   TABLE_SCHEMA    TABLE_NAME      TABLE_TYPE
        oozietest       dbo     mobiledata      BASE TABLE

4. To exit the tsql utility, enter `exit` at the `1>` prompt.

## Create the job definition

The job definition describes where to find the workflow.xml. It also describes where to find other files used by the workflow, such as `useooziewf.hql`. In addition, it defines the values for properties used within the workflow and the associated files.

1. To get the full address of the default storage, use the following command. This address is used in the configuration file you create in the next step.

    ```bash
    sed -n '/<name>fs.default/,/<\/value>/p' /etc/hadoop/conf/core-site.xml
    ```

    This command returns information like the following XML:

    ```xml
    <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
    <value>wasb://mycontainer@mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net</value>
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the HDInsight cluster uses Azure Storage as the default storage, the `<value>` element contents begin with `wasb://`. If Azure Data Lake Store is used instead, it begins with `adl://`.

    Save the contents of the `<value>` element, as it's used in the next steps.

2. To create the Oozie job definition configuration, use the following command:

    ```bash
    nano job.xml
    ```

3. After the nano editor opens, use the following XML as the contents of the file:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <configuration>

        <property>
        <name>nameNode</name>
        <value>wasb://mycontainer@mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net</value>
        </property>

        <property>
        <name>jobTracker</name>
        <value>headnodehost:8050</value>
        </property>

        <property>
        <name>queueName</name>
        <value>default</value>
        </property>

        <property>
        <name>oozie.use.system.libpath</name>
        <value>true</value>
        </property>

        <property>
        <name>hiveScript</name>
        <value>wasb://mycontainer@mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/tutorials/useoozie/useooziewf.hql</value>
        </property>

        <property>
        <name>hiveTableName</name>
        <value>mobilecount</value>
        </property>

        <property>
        <name>hiveDataFolder</name>
        <value>wasb://mycontainer@mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/tutorials/useoozie/data</value>
        </property>

        <property>
        <name>sqlDatabaseConnectionString</name>
        <value>"jdbc:sqlserver://serverName.database.windows.net;user=adminLogin;password=adminPassword;database=oozietest"</value>
        </property>

        <property>
        <name>sqlDatabaseTableName</name>
        <value>mobiledata</value>
        </property>

        <property>
        <name>user.name</name>
        <value>YourName</value>
        </property>

        <property>
        <name>oozie.wf.application.path</name>
        <value>wasb://mycontainer@mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/tutorials/useoozie</value>
        </property>
    </configuration>
    ```

   * Replace all instances of `wasb://mycontainer@mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net` with the value you received earlier for the default storage.

     > [!WARNING]
     > If the path is a `wasb` path, you must use the full path. Do not shorten it to just `wasb:///`.

   * Replace `YourName` with your login name for the HDInsight cluster.
   * Replace `serverName`, `adminLogin`, and `adminPassword` with the information for your SQL database.

     Most of the information in this file is used to populate the values used in the workflow.xml or ooziewf.hql files, such as `${nameNode}`.

     > [!NOTE]
     > The `oozie.wf.application.path` entry defines where to find the workflow.xml file. This file contains the workflow that was run by this job.

5. To save the file, select Ctrl+X, enter `Y`, and then select **Enter**.

## Submit and manage the job

The following steps use the Oozie command to submit and manage Oozie workflows on the cluster. The Oozie command is a friendly interface over the [Oozie REST API](https://oozie.apache.org/docs/4.1.0/WebServicesAPI.html).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you use the Oozie command, you must use the FQDN for the HDInsight head node. This FQDN is only accessible from the cluster, or if the cluster is on an Azure virtual network, from other machines on the same network.


1. To obtain the URL to the Oozie service, use the following command:

    ```bash
    sed -n '/<name>oozie.base.url/,/<\/value>/p' /etc/oozie/conf/oozie-site.xml
    ```

    This returns information like the following XML:

    ```xml
    <name>oozie.base.url</name>
    <value>http://hn0-CLUSTERNAME.randomcharacters.cx.internal.cloudapp.net:11000/oozie</value>
    ```

    The `http://hn0-CLUSTERNAME.randomcharacters.cx.internal.cloudapp.net:11000/oozie` portion is the URL to use with the Oozie command.

2. To create an environment variable for the URL, use the following, so you don't have to enter it for every command:

    ```bash
    export OOZIE_URL=http://HOSTNAMEt:11000/oozie
    ```

    Replace the URL with the one you received earlier.
3. To submit the job, use the following:

    ```bash
    oozie job -config job.xml -submit
    ```

    This command loads the job information from `job.xml` and submits it to Oozie, but does not run it.

    After the command finishes, it should return the ID of the job, for example, `0000005-150622124850154-oozie-oozi-W`. This ID is used to manage the job.

4. To view the status of the job, use the following command:

    ```bash
    oozie job -info <JOBID>
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace `<JOBID>` with the ID returned in the previous step.

    This returns information like the following text:

        Job ID : 0000005-150622124850154-oozie-oozi-W
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Workflow Name : useooziewf
        App Path      : wasb:///tutorials/useoozie
        Status        : PREP
        Run           : 0
        User          : USERNAME
        Group         : -
        Created       : 2015-06-22 15:06 GMT
        Started       : -
        Last Modified : 2015-06-22 15:06 GMT
        Ended         : -
        CoordAction ID: -
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This job has a status of `PREP`. This status indicates that the job was created, but not started.

5. To start the job, use the following command:

    ```bash
    oozie job -start JOBID
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace `<JOBID>` with the ID returned previously.

    If you check the status after this command, it's in a running state, and information is returned for the actions within the job.

6. After the task finishes successfully, you can verify that the data was generated and exported to the SQL database table by using the following command:

    ```bash
    TDSVER=8.0 tsql -H <serverName>.database.windows.net -U <adminLogin> -P <adminPassword> -p 1433 -D oozietest
    ```

    At the `1>` prompt, enter the following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM mobiledata
    GO
    ```

    The information returned is like the following text:

        deviceplatform  count
        Android 31591
        iPhone OS       22731
        proprietary development 3
        RIM OS  3464
        Unknown 213
        Windows Phone   1791
        (6 rows affected)

For more information on the Oozie command, see [Oozie command-line tool](https://oozie.apache.org/docs/4.1.0/DG_CommandLineTool.html).

## Oozie REST API

With the Oozie REST API, you can build your own tools that work with Oozie. The following is HDInsight-specific information about the use of the Oozie REST API:

* **URI**: You can access the REST API from outside the cluster at `https://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/oozie`.

* **Authentication**: To authenticate, use the API the cluster HTTP account (admin) and password. For example:

    ```bash
    curl -u admin:PASSWORD https://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/oozie/versions
    ```

For more information on how to use the Oozie REST API, see [Oozie Web Services API](https://oozie.apache.org/docs/4.1.0/WebServicesAPI.html).

## Oozie web UI

The Oozie web UI provides a web-based view into the status of Oozie jobs on the cluster. With the web UI you can view the following information:

   * Job status
   * Job definition
   * Configuration
   * A graph of the actions in the job
   * Logs for the job

You can also view the details for the actions within a job.

To access the Oozie web UI, complete the following steps:

1. Create an SSH tunnel to the HDInsight cluster. For more information, see [Use SSH Tunneling with HDInsight](hdinsight-linux-ambari-ssh-tunnel.md).

2. After you create a tunnel, open the Ambari web UI in your web browser. The URI for the Ambari site is `https://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net`. Replace `CLUSTERNAME` with the name of your Linux-based HDInsight cluster.

3. From the left side of the page, select **Oozie** > **Quick Links** > **Oozie Web UI**.

    ![Image of the menus](./media/hdinsight-use-oozie-linux-mac/ooziewebuisteps.png)

4. The Oozie web UI defaults to display the running workflow jobs. To see all the workflow jobs, select **All Jobs**.

    ![All jobs displayed](./media/hdinsight-use-oozie-linux-mac/ooziejobs.png)

5. To view more information about a job, select the job.

    ![Job info](./media/hdinsight-use-oozie-linux-mac/jobinfo.png)

6. From the **Job Info** tab, you can see the basic job information and the individual actions within the job. You can use the tabs at the top to view the **Job Definition**, **Job Configuration**, access the **Job Log**, or view a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the job under **Job DAG**.

   * **Job Log**: Select the **Get Logs** button to get all logs for the job, or use the **Enter Search Filter** field to filter the logs.

       ![Job Log](./media/hdinsight-use-oozie-linux-mac/joblog.png)

   * **Job DAG**: The DAG is a graphical overview of the data paths taken through the workflow.

       ![Job DAG](./media/hdinsight-use-oozie-linux-mac/jobdag.png)

7. If you select one of the actions from the **Job Info** tab, it brings up information for the action. For example, select the **RunSqoopExport** action.

    ![Action info](./media/hdinsight-use-oozie-linux-mac/action.png)

8. You can see details for the action, such as a link to the **Console URL**. Use this link to view job tracker information for the job.

## Schedule jobs

You can use the coordinator to specify a start, an end, and the occurrence frequency for jobs. To define a schedule for the workflow, complete the following steps:

1. Use the following command to create a file named **coordinator.xml**:

    ```bash
    nano coordinator.xml
    ```

    Use the following XML as the contents of the file:

    ```xml
    <coordinator-app name="my_coord_app" frequency="${coordFrequency}" start="${coordStart}" end="${coordEnd}" timezone="${coordTimezone}" xmlns="uri:oozie:coordinator:0.4">
        <action>
        <workflow>
            <app-path>${workflowPath}</app-path>
        </workflow>
        </action>
    </coordinator-app>
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `${...}` variables are replaced by values in the job definition at runtime. The variables are:
    >
    > * `${coordFrequency}`: The time between running instances of the job.
    > * `${coordStart}`: The job start time.
    > * `${coordEnd}`: The job end time.
    > * `${coordTimezone}`: Coordinator jobs are in a fixed time zone with no daylight savings time, typically represented by using UTC. This time zone is referred as the *Oozie processing timezone.*
    > * `${wfPath}`: The path to the workflow.xml.

2. To save the file, select Ctrl+X, enter `Y`, and then select **Enter**.

3. To copy the file to the working directory for this job, use the following command:

    ```bash
    hadoop fs -put coordinator.xml /tutorials/useoozie/coordinator.xml
    ```

4. To modify the `job.xml` file, use the following command:

    ```
    nano job.xml
    ```

    Make the following changes:

   * To instruct Oozie to run the coordinator file instead of the workflow, change `<name>oozie.wf.application.path</name>` to `<name>oozie.coord.application.path</name>`.

   * To set the `workflowPath` variable used by the coordinator, add the following XML:

        ```xml
        <property>
            <name>workflowPath</name>
            <value>wasb://mycontainer@mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/tutorials/useoozie</value>
        </property>
        ```

       Replace the `wasb://mycontainer@mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows` text with the value used in the other entries in the job.xml file.

   * To define the start, end, and frequency for the coordinator, add the following XML:

        ```xml
        <property>
            <name>coordStart</name>
            <value>2017-05-10T12:00Z</value>
        </property>

        <property>
            <name>coordEnd</name>
            <value>2017-05-12T12:00Z</value>
        </property>

        <property>
            <name>coordFrequency</name>
            <value>1440</value>
        </property>

        <property>
            <name>coordTimezone</name>
            <value>UTC</value>
        </property>
        ```

       These values set the start time to 12:00 PM on May 10, 2017, and the end time to May 12, 2017. The interval for running this job is set to daily. The frequency is in minutes, so 24 hours x 60 minutes = 1440 minutes. Finally, the time zone is set to UTC.

5. To save the file, select Ctrl+X, enter `Y`, and then select **Enter**.

6. To run the job, use the following command:

    ```
    oozie job -config job.xml -run
    ```

    This command submits and starts the job.

7. If you go to the Oozie web UI and select the **Coordinator Jobs** tab, you see information like in the following image:

    ![Coordinator Jobs tab](./media/hdinsight-use-oozie-linux-mac/coordinatorjob.png)

    The **Next Materialization** entry contains the next time that the job runs.

8. Like the earlier workflow job, if you select the job entry in the web UI it displays information on the job:

    ![Coordinator Job Info](./media/hdinsight-use-oozie-linux-mac/coordinatorjobinfo.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > This image only shows successful runs of the job, not the individual actions within the scheduled workflow. To see the individual actions, select one of the **Action** entries.

    ![Action info](./media/hdinsight-use-oozie-linux-mac/coordinatoractionjob.png)

## Troubleshooting

With the Oozie UI, you can view Oozie logs. The Oozie UI also contains links to the JobTracker logs for the MapReduce tasks that were started by the workflow. The pattern for troubleshooting should be:

   1. View the job in Oozie web UI.

   2. If there is an error or failure for a specific action, select the action to see if the **Error Message** field provides more information on the failure.

   3. If available, use the URL from the action to view more details, such as the JobTracker logs, for the action.

The following are specific errors you might encounter and how to resolve them.

### JA009: Cannot initialize cluster

**Symptoms**: The job status changes to **SUSPENDED**. Details for the job show the `RunHiveScript` status as **START_MANUAL**. Selecting the action displays the following error message:

    JA009: Cannot initialize Cluster. Please check your configuration for map

**Cause**: The Azure Blob storage addresses used in the **job.xml** file doesn't contain the storage container or storage account name. The Blob storage address format must be `wasb://containername@storageaccountname.blob.core.windows.net`.

**Resolution**: Change the Blob storage addresses that the job uses.

### JA002: Oozie is not allowed to impersonate &lt;USER>

**Symptoms**: The job status changes to **SUSPENDED**. Details for the job show the `RunHiveScript` status as **START_MANUAL**. If you select the action, it shows the following error message:

    JA002: User: oozie is not allowed to impersonate <USER>

**Cause**: The current permission settings don't allow Oozie to impersonate the specified user account.

**Resolution**: Oozie can impersonate users in the **users** group. Use the `groups USERNAME` to see the groups that the user account is a member of. If the user is not a member of the **users** group, use the following command to add the user to the group:

    sudo adduser USERNAME users

> [!NOTE]
> It can take several minutes before HDInsight recognizes that the user has been added to the group.

### Launcher ERROR (Sqoop)

**Symptoms**: The job status changes to **KILLED**. Details for the job show the `RunSqoopExport` status as **ERROR**. If you select the action, it shows the following error message:

    Launcher ERROR, reason: Main class [org.apache.oozie.action.hadoop.SqoopMain], exit code [1]

**Cause**: Sqoop is unable to load the database driver required to access the database.

**Resolution**: When you use Sqoop from an Oozie job, you must include the database driver with the other resources, such as the workflow.xml, the job uses. Also, reference the archive that contains the database driver from the `<sqoop>...</sqoop>` section of the workflow.xml.

For example, for the job in this document, you would use the following steps:

1. Copy the `sqljdbc4.1.jar` file to the **/tutorials/useoozie** directory:

    ```bash
    hdfs dfs -put /usr/share/java/sqljdbc_4.1/enu/sqljdbc41.jar /tutorials/useoozie/sqljdbc41.jar
    ```

2. Modify the `workflow.xml` to add the following XML on a new line above `</sqoop>`:

    ```xml
    <archive>sqljdbc41.jar</archive>
    ```
