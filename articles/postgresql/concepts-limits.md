# Limitations in Azure Database for PostgreSQL
The following sections describe capacity and functional limits in the database service.

## Maximum connections
The maximum number of connections per pricing tier and vCores are as follows: 

|**Pricing Tier**| **vCore(s)**| **Max Connections** |
|---|---|---|
|Basic| 1| 50 |
|Basic| 2| 100 |
|General Purpose| 2| 150|
|General Purpose| 4| 250|
|General Purpose| 8| 480|
|General Purpose| 16| 950|
|General Purpose| 32| 1500|
|Memory Optimized| 2| 150|
|Memory Optimized| 4| 250|
|Memory Optimized| 8| 480|
|Memory Optimized| 16| 950|

When connections exceed the limit, you may receive the following error:
> FATAL:  sorry, too many clients already

The Azure system requires five connections to monitor the Azure Database for PostgreSQL server. 

## Functional limitations
### Scale operations
- Dynamic scaling to and from the Basic pricing tiers is currently not supported.
- Decreasing server storage size is currently not supported.

### Server version upgrades
- Automated migration between major database engine versions is currently not supported.

### Subscription management
- Dynamically moving servers across subscriptions and resource groups is currently not supported.

### VNet service endpoints
- Support for VNet service endpoints is only for General Purpose and Memory Optimized servers.

### Point-in-time-restore (PITR)
- When using the PITR feature, the new server is created with the same configurations as the server it is based on.
- Restoring a deleted server is not supported.
