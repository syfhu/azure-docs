**About Azure deployment models**

[!INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-clasic-rm](../../includes/vpn-gateway-classic-rm-include.md)]


## Configuration prerequisites
* You will need the latest version of the Azure Service Management (SM) PowerShell cmdlets. For more information, see [Getting started with Azure PowerShell cmdlets](/powershell/azure/overview).  
* Make sure that you have reviewed the [prerequisites](expressroute-prerequisites.md) page, the [routing requirements](expressroute-routing.md) page, and the [workflows](expressroute-workflows.md) page before you begin configuration.
* You must have an active ExpressRoute circuit. Follow the instructions to [create an ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-circuit-classic.md) and have the circuit enabled by your connectivity provider before you proceed. The ExpressRoute circuit must be in a provisioned and enabled state for you to be able to run the cmdlets described below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These instructions only apply to circuits created with service providers offering Layer 2 connectivity services. If you are using a service provider offering managed Layer 3 services (typically an IPVPN, like MPLS), your connectivity provider will configure and manage routing for you.
> 
> 

You can configure one, two, or all three peerings (Azure private, Azure public and Microsoft) for an ExpressRoute circuit. You can configure peerings in any order you choose. However, you must make sure that you complete the configuration of each peering one at a time.


### Log in to your Azure account and select a subscription
1. Open your PowerShell console with elevated rights and connect to your account. Use the following example to help you connect:

    	Connect-AzureRmAccount

2. Check the subscriptions for the account.

    	Get-AzureRmSubscription

3. If you have more than one subscription, select the subscription that you want to use.

    	Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName "Replace_with_your_subscription_name"

4. Next, use the following cmdlet to add your Azure subscription to PowerShell for the classic deployment model.

		Add-AzureAccount


## Azure private peering
This section provides instructions on how to create, get, update, and delete the Azure private peering configuration for an ExpressRoute circuit. 

### To create Azure private peering
1. **Import the PowerShell module for ExpressRoute.**
   
    You must import the Azure and ExpressRoute modules into the PowerShell session in order to start using the ExpressRoute cmdlets. Run the following commands to import the Azure and ExpressRoute modules into the PowerShell session. The version may vary.    
   
        Import-Module 'C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Azure\5.1.1\Azure\Azure.psd1'
        Import-Module 'C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Azure\5.1.1\ExpressRoute\ExpressRoute.psd1'
2. **Create an ExpressRoute circuit.**
   
    Follow the instructions to create an [ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-circuit-classic.md) and have it provisioned by the connectivity provider. If your connectivity provider offers managed Layer 3 services, you can request your connectivity provider to enable Azure private peering for you. In that case, you won't need to follow instructions listed in the next sections. However, if your connectivity provider does not manage routing for you, after creating your circuit, follow the instructions below. 
3. **Check the ExpressRoute circuit to ensure it is provisioned.**
   
    You must first check to see if the ExpressRoute circuit is Provisioned and also Enabled. See the example below.
   
        PS C:\> Get-AzureDedicatedCircuit -ServiceKey "*********************************"
   
        Bandwidth                        : 200
        CircuitName                      : MyTestCircuit
        Location                         : Silicon Valley
        ServiceKey                       : *********************************
        ServiceProviderName              : equinix
        ServiceProviderProvisioningState : Provisioned
        Sku                              : Standard
        Status                           : Enabled
   
    Make sure that the circuit shows as Provisioned and Enabled. If it doesn't, work with your connectivity provider to get your circuit to the required state and status.
   
        ServiceProviderProvisioningState : Provisioned
        Status                           : Enabled
4. **Configure Azure private peering for the circuit.**
   
    Make sure that you have the following items before you proceed with the next steps:
   
   * A /30 subnet for the primary link. This must not be part of any address space reserved for virtual networks.
   * A /30 subnet for the secondary link. This must not be part of any address space reserved for virtual networks.
   * A valid VLAN ID to establish this peering on. Ensure that no other peering in the circuit uses the same VLAN ID.
   * AS number for peering. You can use both 2-byte and 4-byte AS numbers. You can use a private AS number for this peering. Ensure that you are not using 65515.
   * An MD5 hash if you choose to use one. **This is optional**.
     
	You can run the following cmdlet to configure Azure private peering for your circuit.
     
  		New-AzureBGPPeering -AccessType Private -ServiceKey "*********************************" -PrimaryPeerSubnet "10.0.0.0/30" -SecondaryPeerSubnet "10.0.0.4/30" -PeerAsn 1234 -VlanId 100
     
	You can use the cmdlet below if you choose to use an MD5 hash.
     
  		New-AzureBGPPeering -AccessType Private -ServiceKey "*********************************" -PrimaryPeerSubnet "10.0.0.0/30" -SecondaryPeerSubnet "10.0.0.4/30" -PeerAsn 1234 -VlanId 100 -SharedKey "A1B2C3D4"
     
     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > Ensure that you specify your AS number as peering ASN, not customer ASN.
     >
