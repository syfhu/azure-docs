> [!NOTE]
> To include or exclude a subscription or resource group from Advisor, you must be a subscription Owner.  If you do not have the required permissions for a subscription or resource group, the option to include or exclude it is disabled in the user interface.

4. Click the **Apply** button.

## Configure the average CPU utilization rule for the low usage virtual machine recommendation

Advisor monitors your virtual machine usage for 14 days and then identifies low-utilization virtual machines. Virtual machines whose average CPU utilization is 5 percent or less and network usage is 7 MB or less for four or more days are considered low-utilization virtual machines.

If you would like to be more aggressive at identifying low usage virtual machines, you can adjust the average CPU utilization rule on a per subscription basis.  The average CPU utilization rule can be set to 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20%.

> [!NOTE]
> To adjust the average CPU utilization rule for identifying low usage virtual machines, you must be a subscription *Owner*.  If you do not have the required permissions for a subscription or resource group, the option to include or exclude it will be disabled in the user interface. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and then open [Advisor](https://aka.ms/azureadvisordashboard).

2. Click **Configure** in the action bar.

3. Click the **Rules** tab.

4. Select the subscriptions you’d like to adjust the average CPU utilization rule for, and then click **Edit**.

5. Select the desired average CPU utilization value, and click **Apply**.

6. Click **Refresh recommendations** to update your existing recommendations to use the new average CPU utilization rule.

## Download your Advisor recommendations

Advisor enables you to download a summary of your recommendations.  You can download your recommendations as a PDF file or a CSV file.  Downloading your recommendations enables you to easily share with your colleagues or perform your own analysis on top of the recommendation data.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and then open [Advisor](https://aka.ms/azureadvisordashboard).

2. Click **Download as CSV** or **Download as PDF** on the action bar.

The download option respects any filters you have applied to the Advisor dashboard.  If you select the download option while viewing a specific recommendation category or recommendation, the downloaded summary only includes information for that category or recommendation.
