# Get started with Relay Hybrid Connections HTTP requests in Node

[!INCLUDE [relay-selector-hybrid-connections](../../includes/relay-selector-hybrid-connections.md)]

This tutorial provides an introduction to [Azure Relay Hybrid Connections](relay-what-is-it.md#hybrid-connections) HTTP Requests, and shows how to use Node.js to create a client application that sends messages to a corresponding listener application.

## What will be accomplished

Because Hybrid Connections requires both a client and a server component, create two console applications in this tutorial. Here are the steps:

1. Create a Relay namespace, using the Azure portal.
2. Create a hybrid connection, using the Azure portal.
3. Write a server console application to receive messages.
4. Write a client console application to send messages.

## Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. An Azure subscription.

[!INCLUDE [create-account-note](../../includes/create-account-note.md)]

## 1. Create a namespace using the Azure portal

If you already have a Relay namespace created, jump to the [Create a hybrid connection using the Azure portal](#2-create-a-hybrid-connection-using-the-azure-portal) section.

[!INCLUDE [relay-create-namespace-portal](../../includes/relay-create-namespace-portal.md)]

## 2. Create a hybrid connection using the Azure portal

If you already have a hybrid connection created, jump to the [Create a server application](#3-create-a-server-application-listener) section.

[!INCLUDE [relay-create-hybrid-connection-portal](../../includes/relay-create-hybrid-connection-portal.md)]

## 3. Create a server application (listener)

To listen and receive messages from the Relay, write a Node.js console application.

[!INCLUDE [relay-hybrid-connections-node-get-started-server](../../includes/relay-hybrid-connections-http-requests-node-get-started-server.md)]

## 4. Create a client application (sender)

To send messages to the Relay, you can use any HTTP client, or write a Node.js console application.

[!INCLUDE [relay-hybrid-connections-node-get-started-client](../../includes/relay-hybrid-connections-http-requests-node-get-started-client.md)]

## 5. Run the applications

1. Run the server application: from a Node.js command prompt type `node listener.js`.
2. Run the client application: from a Node.js command prompt type `node sender.js`, and enter some text.
3. Ensure that the server application console outputs the text that was entered in the client application.

Congratulations, you have created an end-to-end Hybrid Connections application using Node.js!
