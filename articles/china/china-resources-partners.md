# Azure China 21Vianet Partners
This page provides various points of contact for Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet (Azure China 21Vianet) partners based on your specific need.

### Local China partner solutions
- To purchase an Indirect Online Service Premium Agreement (OSPA) through a certified partner, please contact your local Microsoft representatives.
- Find a [certified partner for Azure](https://www.azure.cn/partnerancasestudy/partner/) to help you with localized solutions based on your requirements.
- Get ready-to-deploy solutions and optimized, integrated applications and services from the [Azure China Marketplace](https://market.azure.cn/).
- Consider a global partner solution from the [Azure Marketplace](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/), but since most solution data is not configured specifically for Azure China 21Vianet, expect to work around migration issues.
- Use a [Content Delivery Network](/azure/china/china-get-started-service-cdn) (CDN) partner or service to optimize access to your websiteâ€™s streaming content within China.
