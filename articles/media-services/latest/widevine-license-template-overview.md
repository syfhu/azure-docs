# Widevine license template overview

You can use Azure Media Services to configure and request Google Widevine licenses. When the player tries to play your Widevine-protected content, a request is sent to the license delivery service to obtain a license. If the license service approves the request, the service issues the license. It's sent to the client and is used to decrypt and play the specified content.

A Widevine license request is formatted as a JSON message.  

>[!NOTE]
> You can create an empty message with no values, just "{}." Then a license template is created with defaults. The default works for most cases. Microsoft-based license-delivery scenarios should always use the defaults. If you need to set the "provider" and "content_id" values, a provider must match Widevine credentials.

    {  
       "payload":"<license challenge>",
       "content_id": "<content id>"
       "provider": "<provider>"
       "allowed_track_types":"<types>",
       "content_key_specs":[  
          {  
             "track_type":"<track type 1>"
          },
          {  
             "track_type":"<track type 2>"
          },
          …
       ],
       "policy_overrides":{  
          "can_play":<can play>,
          "can persist":<can persist>,
          "can_renew":<can renew>,
          "rental_duration_seconds":<rental duration>,
          "playback_duration_seconds":<playback duration>,
          "license_duration_seconds":<license duration>,
          "renewal_recovery_duration_seconds":<renewal recovery duration>,

          "renewal_retry_interval_seconds":<renewal retry interval>,
          "renew_with_usage”:<renew with usage>
       }
    }

## JSON message

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| payload |Base64-encoded string |The license request sent by a client. |
| content_id |Base64-encoded string |Identifier used to derive the key ID and content key for each content_key_specs.track_type. |
| provider |string |Used to look up content keys and policies. If Microsoft key delivery is used for Widevine license delivery, this parameter is ignored. |
| policy_name |string |Name of a previously registered policy. Optional. |
| allowed_track_types |enum |SD_ONLY or SD_HD. Controls which content keys are included in a license. |
| content_key_specs |Array of JSON structures, see the section "Content key specs."  |A finer-grained control on which content keys to return. For more information, see the section "Content key specs." Only one of the allowed_track_types and content_key_specs values can be specified. |
| use_policy_overrides_exclusively |Boolean, true or false |Use policy attributes specified by policy_overrides, and omit all previously stored policy. |
| policy_overrides |JSON structure, see the section "Policy overrides." |Policy settings for this license.  In the event this asset has a predefined policy, these specified values are used. |
| session_init |JSON structure, see the section "Session initialization." |Optional data is passed to the license. |
| parse_only |Boolean, true or false |The license request is parsed, but no license is issued. However, values from the license request are returned in the response. |

## Content key specs
If a preexisting policy exists, there is no need to specify any of the values in the content key spec. The preexisting policy associated with this content is used to determine the output protection, such as High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) and the Copy General Management System (CGMS). If a preexisting policy isn't registered with the Widevine license server, the content provider can inject the values into the license request.   

Each content_key_specs value must be specified for all tracks, regardless of the use_policy_overrides_exclusively option. 

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| content_key_specs. track_type |string |A track type name. If content_key_specs is specified in the license request, make sure to specify all track types explicitly. Failure to do so results in failure to play back past 10 seconds. |
| content_key_specs  <br/> security_level |uint32 |Defines client robustness requirements for playback. <br/> - Software-based white-box cryptography is required. <br/> - Software cryptography and an obfuscated decoder are required. <br/> - The key material and cryptography operations must be performed within a hardware-backed trusted execution environment. <br/> - The cryptography and decoding of content must be performed within a hardware-backed trusted execution environment.  <br/> - The cryptography, decoding, and all handling of the media (compressed and uncompressed) must be handled within a hardware-backed trusted execution environment. |
| content_key_specs <br/> required_output_protection.hdc |string, one of HDCP_NONE, HDCP_V1, HDCP_V2 |Indicates whether HDCP is required. |
| content_key_specs <br/>key |Base64-<br/>encoded string |Content key to use for this track. If specified, the track_type or key_id is required. The content provider can use this option to inject the content key for this track instead of letting the Widevine license server generate or look up a key. |
| content_key_specs.key_id |Base64-encoded string binary, 16 bytes |Unique identifier for the key. |

## Policy overrides
| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| policy_overrides&#46;can_play |Boolean, true or false |Indicates that playback of the content is allowed. Default is false. |
| policy_overrides&#46;can_persist |Boolean, true or false |Indicates that the license might be persisted to nonvolatile storage for offline use. Default is false. |
| policy_overrides&#46;can_renew |Boolean, true or false |Indicates that renewal of this license is allowed. If true, the duration of the license can be extended by heartbeat. Default is false. |
| policy_overrides&#46;license_duration_seconds |int64 |Indicates the time window for this specific license. A value of 0 indicates that there is no limit to the duration. Default is 0. |
| policy_overrides&#46;rental_duration_seconds |int64 |Indicates the time window while playback is permitted. A value of 0 indicates that there is no limit to the duration. Default is 0. |
| policy_overrides&#46;playback_duration_seconds |int64 |The viewing window of time after playback starts within the license duration. A value of 0 indicates that there is no limit to the duration. Default is 0. |
| policy_overrides&#46;renewal_server_url |string |All heartbeat (renewal) requests for this license are directed to the specified URL. This field is used only if can_renew is true. |
| policy_overrides&#46;renewal_delay_seconds |int64 |How many seconds after license_start_time before renewal is first attempted. This field is used only if can_renew is true. Default is 0. |
| policy_overrides&#46;renewal_retry_interval_seconds |int64 |Specifies the delay in seconds between subsequent license renewal requests, in case of failure. This field is used only if can_renew is true. |
| policy_overrides&#46;renewal_recovery_duration_seconds |int64 |The window of time in which playback can continue while renewal is attempted, yet unsuccessful due to back-end problems with the license server. A value of 0 indicates that there is no limit to the duration. This field is used only if can_renew is true. |
| policy_overrides&#46;renew_with_usage |Boolean, true or false |Indicates that the license is sent for renewal when usage starts. This field is used only if can_renew is true. |

## Session initialization
| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| provider_session_token |Base64-encoded string |This session token is passed back in the license and exists in subsequent renewals. The session token doesn't persist beyond sessions. |
| provider_client_token |Base64-encoded string |Client token to send back in the license response. If the license request contains a client token, this value is ignored. The client token persists beyond license sessions. |
| override_provider_client_token |Boolean, true or false |If false and the license request contains a client token, use the token from the request even if a client token was specified in this structure. If true, always use the token specified in this structure. |

## Configure your Widevine license with .NET 

Media Services provides a class that lets you configure a Widevine license. To construct the license, pass JSON to [WidevineTemplate](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.management.media.models.contentkeypolicywidevineconfiguration.widevinetemplate?view=azure-dotnet#Microsoft_Azure_Management_Media_Models_ContentKeyPolicyWidevineConfiguration_WidevineTemplate).

To configure the template you can:

1.	Directly construct/hardcode a JSON string (which may be error-prone);

    ```csharp
        ContentKeyPolicyWidevineConfiguration objContentKeyPolicyWidevineConfiguration = new ContentKeyPolicyWidevineConfiguration
    {
        WidevineTemplate = @"{""allowed_track_types"":""SD_HD"",""content_key_specs"":[{""track_type"":""SD"",""security_level"":1,""required_output_protection"":{""hdcp"":""HDCP_V2""}}],""policy_overrides"":{""can_play"":true,""can_persist"":true,""can_renew"":false}}"
    };
    ```

2.	Construct needed classes with properties mapping to those JSON attributes and instantiate them before serializing them to JSON string. Below is an example of such classes and how they are instantiated and serialized.

    ```csharp
    public class policy_overrides
    {
        public bool can_play { get; set; }
        public bool can_persist { get; set; }
        public bool can_renew { get; set; }
        public int rental_duration_seconds { get; set; }    //Indicates the time window while playback is permitted. A value of 0 indicates that there is no limit to the duration. Default is 0.
        public int playback_duration_seconds { get; set; }  //The viewing window of time after playback starts within the license duration. A value of 0 indicates that there is no limit to the duration. Default is 0.
        public int license_duration_seconds { get; set; }   //Indicates the time window for this specific license. A value of 0 indicates that there is no limit to the duration. Default is 0.
    }

    public class content_key_spec
    {
        public string track_type { get; set; }
        public int security_level { get; set; }
        public output_protection required_output_protection { get; set; }
    }

    public class output_protection
    {
        public string hdcp { get; set; }
    }

    public class widevine_template
    {
        public string allowed_track_types { get; set; }
        public content_key_spec[] content_key_specs { get; set; }
        public policy_overrides policy_overrides { get; set; }
    }
    ```

### Configure the license

Use classes defined in the previous section to create JSON that is used to configure [WidevineTemplate](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.management.media.models.contentkeypolicywidevineconfiguration.widevinetemplate?view=azure-dotnet#Microsoft_Azure_Management_Media_Models_ContentKeyPolicyWidevineConfiguration_WidevineTemplate):

```csharp
void ConfigureLicense()
{
    widevine_template objwidevine_template = new widevine_template()
    {
        allowed_track_types = "SD_HD",
        content_key_specs = new content_key_spec[]
        {
            new content_key_spec()
            {
                track_type = "SD",
                security_level = 1,
                required_output_protection = new output_protection()
                {
                hdcp = "HDCP_V2"
                }
            }
        },
        policy_overrides = new policy_overrides()
        {
            can_play = true,
            can_persist = true,
            can_renew = false,
            license_duration_seconds = 2592000,
            playback_duration_seconds = 10800,
            rental_duration_seconds = 604800,
        }
    };

    ContentKeyPolicyWidevineConfiguration objContentKeyPolicyWidevineConfiguration = new ContentKeyPolicyWidevineConfiguration
    {
        WidevineTemplate = Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.SerializeObject(objwidevine_template)
    };
}
```
