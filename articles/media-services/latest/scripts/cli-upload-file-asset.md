# CLI example: Upload a local file to a container 

The Azure CLI script in this article shows how to upload a local file to a storage container.

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this article requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.20 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Example script
