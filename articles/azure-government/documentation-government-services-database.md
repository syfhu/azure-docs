# Azure Government Databases
## SQL Database
For more information, see the<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb510589.aspx"> Microsoft Security Center for SQL Database Engine </a> and [Azure SQL Database documentation](../sql-database/index.yml) for additional guidance on metadata visibility configuration, and protection best practices.

### Variations

The Address for SQL Azure Servers in Azure Government is different:

| Service Type | Azure Public | Azure Government |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SQL Database |*.database.windows.net |*.database.usgovcloudapi.net |

### Considerations
The following information identifies the Azure Government boundary for Azure SQL:

| Regulated/controlled data permitted | Regulated/controlled data not permitted |
| --- | --- |
| All data stored and processed in Microsoft Azure SQL can contain Azure Government-regulated data. Use database tools for data transfer of Azure Government-regulated data. |Azure SQL metadata is not permitted to contain export-controlled data. This metadata includes all configuration data entered when creating and maintaining your storage product.  Do not enter regulated/controlled data into the following fields: Database name, Subscription name, Resource groups, Server name, Server admin login, Deployment names, Resource names, Resource tags |

## SQL Data Warehouse
For details on this service and how to use it, see [Azure SQL Data Warehouse documentation](../sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-overview-what-is.md).

## SQL Server Stretch Database

| Service Type | Azure Public | Azure Government |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cosmos DB | *.documents.azure.com | *.documents.azure.us |


### Considerations
The following information identifies the Azure Government boundary for Azure Cosmos DB:

| Regulated/controlled data permitted | Regulated/controlled data not permitted |
| --- | --- |
| All data stored and processed in Azure Cosmos DB can contain Azure Government-regulated data. |Azure Cosmos DB metadata is not permitted to contain export-controlled data. Do not enter regulated/controlled data into the following fields: **DB name, Subscription name, Resource groups, Resource tags**. |


## Azure Redis Cache
For details on this service and how to use it, see [Azure Redis Cache documentation](../redis-cache/index.md).

### Variations
The URLs for accessing and managing Azure Redis Cache in Azure Government are different:

| Service Type | Azure Public | Azure Government |

| Cache endpoint |*.redis.cache.windows.net |*.redis.cache.usgovcloudapi.net |

> [!NOTE]
> All scripts and code need to account for the appropriate endpoints and environments. For more information, see [How to connect to other clouds](../redis-cache/cache-howto-manage-redis-cache-powershell.md#how-to-connect-to-other-clouds).
