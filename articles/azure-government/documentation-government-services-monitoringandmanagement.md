### Variations
The following Site Recovery features are not currently available in Azure Government:
* Email notification

| Site Recovery | Classic | Resource Manager |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VMWare/Physical  | GA | GA |
| Hyper-V | GA | GA |
| Site to Site | GA | GA |

The following URLs for Site Recovery are different in Azure Government:

| Azure Public | Azure Government | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \*.hypervrecoverymanager.windowsazure.com | \*.hypervrecoverymanager.windowsazure.us | Access to the Site Recovery Service |
| \*.backup.windowsazure.com  | \*.backup.windowsazure.us | Access to Protection Service |
| \*.blob.core.windows.net | \*.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net | For storing the VM Snapshots |
| http://cdn.mysql.com/archives/mysql-5.5/mysql-5.5.37-win32.msi | http://cdn.mysql.com/archives/mysql-5.5/mysql-5.5.37-win32.msi | To download MySQL |

## Monitor
Azure Monitor is generally available in Azure Government.

For more information, see [Monitor commercial documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview).

### Variations
The following sections detail differences and workarounds for features of Azure Monitor in Azure Government:

#### Action Groups 
Action Groups are generally available in Azure Government with no differences from commercial Azure.   

#### Activity Log Alerts
Activity Log Alerts are generally available in Azure Government with no differences from commercial Azure. 

#### Alerts Experience
The unified alerts UI experience is not available in Azure Government. 

#### Autoscale
Autoscale is generally available in Azure Government.

If you are using PowerShell/ARM/REST calls to specify settings, set the "Location" of the Autoscale to "USGov Virginia" or "USGov Iowa". The resource targeted by Autoscale can exist in any region. An example of the setting is below:

```PowerShell
$rule1 = New-AzureRmAutoscaleRule -MetricName "Requests" -MetricResourceId "/subscriptions/S1/resourceGroups/RG1/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/WebSite1" -Operator GreaterThan -MetricStatistic Average -Threshold 10 -TimeGrain 00:01:00 -ScaleActionCooldown 00:05:00 -ScaleActionDirection Increase -ScaleActionScaleType ChangeCount -ScaleActionValue "1" 
$rule2 = New-AzureRmAutoscaleRule -MetricName "Requests" -MetricResourceId "/subscriptions/S1/resourceGroups/RG1/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/WebSite1" -Operator GreaterThan -MetricStatistic Average -Threshold 10 -TimeGrain 00:01:00 -ScaleActionCooldown 00:10:00 -ScaleActionDirection Increase -ScaleActionScaleType ChangeCount -ScaleActionValue "2"
$profile1 = New-AzureRmAutoscaleProfile -DefaultCapacity 2 -MaximumCapacity 10 -MinimumCapacity 2 -Rules $rule1, $rule2 -Name "MyProfile"
$webhook_scale = New-AzureRmAutoscaleWebhook -ServiceUri https://example.com?mytoken=mytokenvalue
$notification1= New-AzureRmAutoscaleNotification -CustomEmails myname@company.com -SendEmailToSubscriptionAdministrator -SendEmailToSubscriptionCoAdministrators -Webhooks $webhook_scale
Add-AzureRmAutoscaleSetting -Location "USGov Virginia" -Name "MyScaleVMSSSetting" -ResourceGroup sdubeys-usgv -TargetResourceId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/rg1/providers/Microsoft.Web/serverFarms/ServerFarm1 -AutoscaleProfiles $profile1 -Notifications $notification1
```

If you are interested in implementing autoscale on your resources, use PowerShell/ARM/Rest calls to specify the settings. 

For more information on using PowerShell, see [public documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-powershell-samples#create-and-manage-autoscale-settings).

#### Diagnostic Logs
Diagnostic Logs are generally available in Azure Government with no differences from commercial Azure.

#### Metrics
Metrics are generally available in Azure Government. However, multi-dimensional metrics are supported only via the REST API. The ability to [show multi-dimensional metrics](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-metric-charts.md) is in preview in the Azure Government portal. 

#### Metric Alerts
The first generation of metrics alerts is generally available in both Azure Government and commercial Azure. The first generation is called *Alerts (Classic)*.  A second generation of alerts is available only in commercial Azure.  

When using PowerShell/ARM/Rest calls to create Metric Alerts, you will need to set the "Location" of the metric alert to "USGov Virginia" or "USGov Iowa". An example of the setting is below:

```PowerShell
$actionEmail = New-AzureRmAlertRuleEmail -CustomEmail myname@company.com 
$actionWebhook = New-AzureRmAlertRuleWebhook -ServiceUri https://example.com?token=mytoken 
Add-AzureRmMetricAlertRule -Name vmcpu_gt_1 -Location "USGov Virginia" -ResourceGroup myrg1 -TargetResourceId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/myrg1/providers/Microsoft.ClassicCompute/virtualMachines/my_vm1 -MetricName "Percentage CPU" -Operator GreaterThan -Threshold 1 -WindowSize 00:05:00 -TimeAggregationOperator Average -Actions $actionEmail, $actionWebhook -Description "alert on CPU > 1%" 
```

For more information on using PowerShell, see [public documentation](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-powershell-samples.md).
