### Azure Security Center FAQs
 
For Azure Security Center FAQs, see [Azure Security Center frequently asked questions public documentation](../security-center/security-center-faq.md). Additional FAQs for Azure Security Center in Azure Government are listed below. 


**What will customers be charged for Azure Security Center in Azure Government?** </br>The Standard tier of Azure Security Center is free for the first 60 days. Should you choose to continue to use public preview or generally available Standard features beyond 60 days, we automatically start to charge for the service.

**What features are available for Azure Security Center government customers?**</br>A detailed list of feature variations in the Azure Security Center government offering can found in the [variations section](#bkmk_ASCVariations) of this article. All other Azure Security Center capabilities can be referenced in the [Azure Security Center public documentation](../security-center/index.yml).  

**What is the compliance commitment for Azure Security Center in Azure Government?**</br>Azure Security Center engineering has committed to the FedRAMP-High compliance standard with planned audit participation no later than February 2019. We will provide additional updates on this process and certification as this progresses. 

**Is Azure Security Center available for DoD customers?**</br>Azure Security Center is deployed on Azure Government regions but not DoD regions. Azure resources created in DoD regions can still utilize Security Center capabilities. However, using it will result in Security Center collected data being moved out from DoD regions and stored in Azure Government regions. By default, all Security Center features which collect and store data are disabled for resources hosted in DoD regions. The type of data collected and stored varies depending on the selected feature. Customers who want to enable Azure Security Center features for DoD resources are recommended to consider data residency before doing so.
