# Create and provision a simulated TPM device using C device SDK for IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service

[!INCLUDE [iot-dps-selector-quick-create-simulated-device-tpm](../../includes/iot-dps-selector-quick-create-simulated-device-tpm.md)]

These steps show how to create a simulated device on your development machine running Windows OS, run the Windows TPM simulator as the [Hardware Security Module (HSM)](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-iot-supports-new-security-hardware-to-strengthen-iot-security/) of the device, and use the code sample to connect this simulated device with the Device Provisioning Service and your IoT hub. 

If you're unfamiliar with the process of auto-provisioning, be sure to also review [Auto-provisioning concepts](concepts-auto-provisioning.md). Also make sure you've completed the steps in [Set up IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service with the Azure portal](./quick-setup-auto-provision.md) before continuing.

## Prepare the development environment 

1. Make sure you have either Visual Studio 2015 or [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/) installed on your machine. You must have ['Desktop development with C++'](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/support/selecting-workloads-visual-studio-2017/) workload enabled for your Visual Studio installation.

2. Download and install the [CMake build system](https://cmake.org/download/). It is important that the Visual Studio with 'Desktop development with C++' workload is installed on your machine, **before** the `cmake` installation.

3. Make sure `git` is installed on your machine and is added to the environment variables accessible to the command window. See [Software Freedom Conservancy's Git client tools](https://git-scm.com/download/) for the latest version of `git` tools to install, which includes the **Git Bash**, the command-line app that you can use to interact with your local Git repository. 

4. Open a command prompt or Git Bash. Clone the GitHub repo for device simulation code sample:
    
    ```cmd/sh
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git --recursive
    ```

5. Create a folder in your local copy of this GitHub repo for CMake build process. 

    ```cmd/sh
    cd azure-iot-sdk-c
    mkdir cmake
    cd cmake
    ```

6. The code sample uses a Windows TPM simulator to provide attestation via SAS Token authentication. Run the following command to build a version of the SDK specific to your development client platform and [attestation mechanism](concepts-security.md#attestation-mechanism) (TPM Simulator). It also generates a Visual Studio solution for the simulated device.

    ```cmd/sh
    cmake -Duse_prov_client:BOOL=ON -Duse_tpm_simulator:BOOL=ON ..
    ```

    If `cmake` does not find your C++ compiler, you might get build errors while running the above command. If that happens, try running this command in the [Visual Studio command prompt](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs). 

7. In a separate command prompt, navigate to the GitHub root folder and run the [TPM](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/device-security/tpm/trusted-platform-module-overview) simulator. It listens over a socket on ports 2321 and 2322. Do not close this command window; you will need to keep this simulator running until the end of this Quickstart guide. 

   If you are in the *cmake* folder, then run the following commands:

    ```cmd/sh
    cd..
    .\provisioning_client\deps\utpm\tools\tpm_simulator\Simulator.exe
    ```

## Simulate TPM device

1. Open the solution generated in the *cmake* folder named `azure_iot_sdks.sln`, and build it in Visual Studio.

2. In the *Solution Explorer* pane in Visual Studio, navigate to the folder **Provision\_Tools**. Right-click the **tpm_device_provision** project and select **Set as Startup Project**. 

3. Run the solution. The output window displays the **_Registration ID_** and the **_Endorsement Key_** needed for device enrollment. Note down these values. 


<a id="portalenrollment"></a>

## Create a device enrollment entry in the portal

1. Log in to the Azure portal, click on the **All resources** button on the left-hand menu and open your Device Provisioning service.

2. On the Device Provisioning Service summary blade, select **Manage enrollments**. Select **Individual Enrollments** tab and click the **Add** button at the top. 

3. Under the **Add enrollment list entry**, enter the following information:
    - Select **TPM** as the identity attestation *Mechanism*.
    - Enter the *Registration ID* and *Endorsement key* for your TPM device.
    - Optionally, you may provide the following information:
        - Select an IoT hub linked with your provisioning service.
        - Enter a unique device ID. Make sure to avoid sensitive data while naming your device.
        - Update the **Initial device twin state** with the desired initial configuration for the device.
    - Once complete, click the **Save** button. 

    ![Enter device enrollment information in the portal blade](./media/quick-create-simulated-device/enter-device-enrollment.png)  

   On successful enrollment, the *Registration ID* of your device will appear in the list under the *Individual Enrollments* tab. 


<a id="firstbootsequence"></a>

## Simulate first boot sequence for the device

1. In the Azure portal, select the **Overview** blade for your Device Provisioning service and note down the **_ID Scope_** value.

    ![Extract DPS endpoint information from the portal blade](./media/quick-create-simulated-device/extract-dps-endpoints.png) 

2. In the Visual Studio *Solution Explorer* on your machine, navigate to the folder **Provision\_Samples**. Select the sample project named **prov\_dev\_client\_sample** and open the file **prov\_dev\_client\_sample.c**.

3. Assign the _ID Scope_ value to the `id_scope` variable. 

    ```c
    static const char* id_scope = "[ID Scope]";
    ```

4. In the **main()** function in the same file, make sure the **SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE** is set to TPM.

    ```c
    SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE hsm_type;
    hsm_type = SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_TPM;
    ```

   Comment out or delete the statement `hsm_type = SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_X509;` that is present by default. 

5. Right-click the **prov\_dev\_client\_sample** project and select **Set as Startup Project**. Run the solution. 

6. Notice the messages that simulate the device booting and connecting to the Device Provisioning Service to get your IoT hub information. On successful provisioning of your simulated device to the IoT hub linked with your provisioning service, the device ID appears on the hub's **IoT Devices** blade. 

    ![Device is registered with the IoT hub](./media/quick-create-simulated-device/hub-registration.png) 

    If you changed the *initial device twin state* from the default value in the enrollment entry for your device, it can pull the desired twin state from the hub and act accordingly. For more information, see [Understand and use device twins in IoT Hub](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins.md)


## Clean up resources

If you plan to continue working on and exploring the device client sample, do not clean up the resources created in this Quickstart. If you do not plan to continue, use the following steps to delete all resources created by this Quickstart.

1. Close the device client sample output window on your machine.
1. Close the TPM simulator window on your machine.
1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, click **All resources** and then select your Device Provisioning service. Open the **Manage Enrollments** blade for your service, and then click the **Individual Enrollments** tab. Select the *REGISTRATION ID* of the device you enrolled in this Quickstart, and click the **Delete** button at the top. 
1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, click **All resources** and then select your IoT hub. Open the **IoT Devices** blade for your hub, select the *DEVICE ID* of the device you registered in this Quickstart, and then click **Delete** button at the top.

## Next steps

In this Quickstart, youâ€™ve created a TPM simulated device on your machine and provisioned it to your IoT hub using the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service. To learn how to enroll your TPM device programmatically, continue to the Quickstart for programmatic enrollment of a TPM device.
