# Enroll X.509 devices to IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service using Java service SDK

[!INCLUDE [iot-dps-selector-quick-enroll-device-x509](../../includes/iot-dps-selector-quick-enroll-device-x509.md)]

These steps show how to enroll a group of X.509 simulated devices programmatically to the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service, using the [Java Service SDK](https://azure.github.io/azure-iot-sdk-java/service/) with the help of a sample Java application. Although the Java Service SDK works on both Windows and Linux machines, this article uses a Windows development machine to walk through the enrollment process.

Make sure to [set up IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service with the Azure portal](./quick-setup-auto-provision.md) before you proceed.

## Prepare the development environment 

1. Make sure you have [Java SE Development Kit 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed on your machine. 

2. Set up environment variables for your Java installation. The `PATH` variable should include the full path to *jdk1.8.x\bin* directory. If this is your machine's first Java installation, then create a new environment variable named `JAVA_HOME` and point it to the full path to the *jdk1.8.x* directory. On Windows machine, this directory is usually found in the *C:\\Program Files\\Java\\* folder, and you can create or edit environment variables by searching for **Edit the system environment variables** on the **Control panel** of your Windows machine. 

  You may check if Java is successfully set up on your machine by running the following command on your command window:

    ```cmd\sh
    java -version
    ```

3. Download and extract [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) on your machine. 

4. Edit environment variable `PATH` to point to the *apache-maven-3.x.x\\bin* folder inside the folder where Maven is extracted. You may confirm that Maven is successfully installed by running this command on your command window:

    ```cmd\sh
    mvn --version
    ```

5. Make sure [git](https://git-scm.com/download/) is installed on your machine and is added to the environment variable `PATH`.

## Download and modify the Java sample code

This section shows how to add the provisioning details of your X.509 device to the sample code. 

1. Open a command prompt. Clone the GitHub repo for device enrollment code sample using the Java Service SDK:
    
    ```cmd\sh
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java.git --recursive
    ```

2. In the downloaded source code, navigate to the sample folder **_azure-iot-sdk-java/provisioning/provisioning-samples/service-enrollment-group-sample_**. Open the file **_/src/main/java/samples/com/microsoft/azure/sdk/iot/ServiceEnrollmentGroupSample.java_** in an editor of your choice, and add the following details:

    1. Add the `[Provisioning Connection String]` for your provisioning service, from the portal as following:
        1. Navigate to your provisioning service in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 
        2. Open the **Shared access policies**, and select a policy which has the *EnrollmentWrite* permission.
        3. Copy the **Primary key connection string**. 

            ![Get the provisioning connection string from portal](./media/quick-enroll-device-x509-java/provisioning-string.png)  

        4. In the sample code file **_ServiceEnrollmentGroupSample.java_**, replace the `[Provisioning Connection String]` with the **Primary key connection string**.

            ```Java
            private static final String PROVISIONING_CONNECTION_STRING = "[Provisioning Connection String]";
            ```

    2. Add the root certificate for the group of devices. If you need a sample root certificate, use the _X.509 certificate generator_ tool as follows:
        1. In a command window, navigate to the folder **_azure-iot-sdk-java/provisioning/provisioning-tools/provisioning-x509-cert-generator_**.
        2. Build the tool by running the following command:

                ```cmd\sh
                mvn clean install
                ```

        4. Run the tool using the following commands:

                ```cmd\sh
                cd target
                java -jar ./provisioning-x509-cert-generator-{version}-with-deps.jar
                ```

        5. When prompted, you may optionally enter a _Common Name_ for your certificates.
        6. The tool locally generates a **Client Cert**, the **Client Cert Private Key**, and the **Root Cert**.
        7. Copy the **Root Cert**, including the lines **_-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----_** and **_-----END CERTIFICATE-----_**. 
        8. Assign the value of the **Root Cert** to the parameter **PUBLIC_KEY_CERTIFICATE_STRING** as shown below:

                ```Java
                private static final String PUBLIC_KEY_CERTIFICATE_STRING =
                        "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n" +
                        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
                        "-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n";
                ```

        9. Close the command window, or enter **n** when prompted for *Verification Code*. 
 
    3. Optionally, you may configure your provisioning service through the sample code:
        - To add this configuration to the sample, follow these steps:
            1. Navigate to the IoT hub linked to your provisioning service in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Open the **Overview** tab for the hub, and copy the **Hostname**. Assign this **Hostname** to the *IOTHUB_HOST_NAME* parameter.

                ```Java
                private static final String IOTHUB_HOST_NAME = "[Host name].azure-devices.net";
                ```
            2. Assign a friendly name to the *DEVICE_ID* parameter, and keep the *PROVISIONING_STATUS* as the default *ENABLED* value. 

        - OR, if you choose not to configure your provisioning service, make sure to comment out or delete the following statements in the _ServiceEnrollmentGroupSample.java_ file:

            ```Java
            enrollmentGroup.setIotHubHostName(IOTHUB_HOST_NAME);                // Optional parameter.
            enrollmentGroup.setProvisioningStatus(ProvisioningStatus.ENABLED);  // Optional parameter.
            ```

    4. Study the sample code. It creates, updates, queries and deletes a group enrollment for X.509 devices. To verify successful enrollment in portal, temporarily comment out the following lines of code at the end of the _ServiceEnrollmentGroupSample.java_ file:

        ```Java
        // ************************************** Delete info of enrollmentGroup ***************************************
        System.out.println("\nDelete the enrollmentGroup...");
        provisioningServiceClient.deleteEnrollmentGroup(enrollmentGroupId);
        ```

    5. Save the file _ServiceEnrollmentGroupSample.java_. 
 

<a id="runjavasample"></a>

## Build and run sample group enrollment

1. Open a command window, and navigate to the folder **_azure-iot-sdk-java/provisioning/provisioning-samples/service-enrollment-group-sample_**.

2. Build the sample code by using this command:

    ```cmd\sh
    mvn install -DskipTests
    ```

   This command downloads the Maven package [`com.microsoft.azure.sdk.iot.provisioning.service`](https://www.mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.microsoft.azure.sdk.iot.provisioning/provisioning-service-client) to your machine. This package includes the binaries for the Java service SDK, that the sample code needs to build. If you ran the _X.509 certificate generator_ tool in the preceding section, this package will be already downloaded on your machine. 

3. Run the sample by using these commands at the command window:

    ```cmd\sh
    cd target
    java -jar ./service-enrollment-group-sample-{version}-with-deps.jar
    ```

4. Observe the output window for successful enrollment.

5. Navigate to your provisioning service in the Azure portal. Click **Manage enrollments**. Notice that your group of X.509 devices appears under the **Enrollment Groups** tab, with an auto-generated *GROUP NAME*.

## Modifications to enroll a single X.509 device

To enroll a single X.509 device, modify the *individual enrollment* sample code used in [Enroll TPM device to IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service using Java service SDK](quick-enroll-device-tpm-java.md#javasample) as follows:

1. Copy the *Common Name* of your X.509 client certificate to the clipboard. If you wish to use the _X.509 certificate generator_ tool as shown in the [preceding sample code section](#javasample), either enter a _Common Name_ for your certificate, or use the default **microsoftriotcore**. Use this **Common Name** as the value for the *REGISTRATION_ID* variable. 

    ```Java
    // Use common name of your X.509 client certificate
    private static final String REGISTRATION_ID = "[RegistrationId]";
    ```

2. Rename the variable *TPM_ENDORSEMENT_KEY* as *PUBLIC_KEY_CERTIFICATE_STRING*. Copy your client certificate or the **Client Cert** from the output of the _X.509 certificate generator_ tool, as the value for the *PUBLIC_KEY_CERTIFICATE_STRING* variable. 

    ```Java
    // Rename the variable *TPM_ENDORSEMENT_KEY* as *PUBLIC_KEY_CERTIFICATE_STRING*
    private static final String PUBLIC_KEY_CERTIFICATE_STRING =
            "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n";
    ```
3. In the **main** function, replace the line `Attestation attestation = new TpmAttestation(TPM_ENDORSEMENT_KEY);` with the following to use the X.509 client certificate:
    ```Java
    Attestation attestation = X509Attestation.createFromClientCertificates(PUBLIC_KEY_CERTIFICATE_STRING);
    ```

4. Save, build and run the *individual enrollment* sample file, using the steps in the section [Build and run the sample code for individual enrollment](quick-enroll-device-tpm-java.md#runjavasample).
