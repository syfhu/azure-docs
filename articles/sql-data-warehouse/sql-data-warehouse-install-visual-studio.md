# Install Visual Studio and SSDT for SQL Data Warehouse
To develop applications for SQL Data Warehouse, we recommend using the most recent version of Visual Studio with the most recent version of SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT).  Visual Studio 2013 Update 5 with SSDT is also supported for backward compatibility.  

Using Visual Studio with SSDT allows you to use the SQL Server Object Explorer to visually explore tables, views, stored procedures, and many more objects in your SQL Data Warehouse as well as run queries.

2. Follow the [Installing Visual Studio][Installing Visual Studio] guide on MSDN and choose the default configurations.

## Step 2: Install SSDT

If the option to install is not available from Visual Studio, alternatively you can visit the [SSDT Download][SSDT Download] page to download and install SSDT manually.
