# Send events to a Time Series Insights environment using event hub
This article explains how to create and configure event hub and run a sample application to push events. If you have an existing event hub with events in JSON format, skip this tutorial and view your environment in [Time Series Insights](https://insights.timeseries.azure.com).

## Configure an event hub
1. To create an event hub, follow instructions from the Event Hub [documentation](../event-hubs/event-hubs-create.md).

2. Search for **event hub** in the search bar. Click **Event Hubs** in the returned list.

3. Select your event hub by clicking on its name.

4. Under **Entities** in the middle configuration window, click **Event Hubs** again.

5. Select the name of the event hub to configure it.

6. Under **Entities**, select **Consumer groups**.
 
7. Make sure you create a consumer group that is used exclusively by your Time Series Insights event source.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Make sure this consumer group is not used by any other service (such as Stream Analytics job or another Time Series Insights environment). If the consumer group is used by other services, read operation is negatively affected for this environment and the other services. If you are using “$Default” as the consumer group, it could lead to potential reuse by other readers.

8. Under the **Settings** heading, select **Share access policies**.

9. On the event hub, create **MySendPolicy** that is used to send events in the csharp sample.

## Add Time Series Insights reference data set 
Using reference data in TSI contextualizes your telemetry data.  That context adds meaning to your data and makes it easier to filter and aggregate.  TSI joins reference data at ingress time and cannot retroactively join this data.  Therefore, it is critical to add reference data prior to adding an event source with data.  Data like location or sensor type are useful dimensions that you might want to join to a device/tag/sensor ID to make it easier to slice and filter.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Having a reference data set configured is critical when you upload historical data.

Ensure that you have reference data in place when you bulk upload historical data to TSI.  Keep in mind, TSI will immediately start reading from a joined event source if that event source has data.  It's useful to wait to join an event source to TSI until you have your reference data in place, especially if that event source has data in it. Alternatively, you can wait to push data to that event source until the reference data set is in place.

To manage reference data, there is the web-based user interface in the TSI Explorer, and there is a programmatic C# API. TSI Explorer has a visual user experience to upload files or paste-in existing reference data sets as JSON or CSV format. With the API, you can build a custom app when needed.

For more information on managing reference data in Time Series Insights, see the [reference data article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/time-series-insights/time-series-insights-add-reference-data-set).

## Create Time Series Insights event source
1. If you haven't created an event source, follow [these instructions](time-series-insights-how-to-add-an-event-source-eventhub.md) to create an event source.

2. Specify **deviceTimestamp** as the timestamp property name – this property is used as the actual timestamp in the C# sample. The timestamp property name is case-sensitive and values must follow the format __yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.FFFFFFFK__ when sent as JSON to event hub. If the property does not exist in the event, then the event hub enqueued time is used.

## Sample code to push events
1. Go to the event hub policy named **MySendPolicy**. Copy the **connection string** with the policy key.

  ![Copy MySendPolicy connection string](media/send-events/sample-code-connection-string.png)

2. Run the following code that to send 600 events per each of the three devices. Update `eventHubConnectionString` with your connection string.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Globalization;
using System.IO;
using Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging;

namespace Microsoft.Rdx.DataGenerator
{
    internal class Program
    {
        private static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var from = new DateTime(2017, 4, 20, 15, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc);
            Random r = new Random();
            const int numberOfEvents = 600;

            var deviceIds = new[] { "device1", "device2", "device3" };

            var events = new List<string>();
            for (int i = 0; i < numberOfEvents; ++i)
            {
                for (int device = 0; device < deviceIds.Length; ++device)
                {
                    // Generate event and serialize as JSON object:
                    // { "deviceTimestamp": "utc timestamp", "deviceId": "guid", "value": 123.456 }
                    events.Add(
                        String.Format(
                            CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,
                            @"{{ ""deviceTimestamp"": ""{0}"", ""deviceId"": ""{1}"", ""value"": {2} }}",
                            (from + TimeSpan.FromSeconds(i * 30)).ToString("o"),
                            deviceIds[device],
                            r.NextDouble()));
                }
            }

            // Create event hub connection.
            var eventHubConnectionString = @"Endpoint=sb://...";
            var eventHubClient = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(eventHubConnectionString);

            using (var ms = new MemoryStream())
            using (var sw = new StreamWriter(ms))
            {
                // Wrap events into JSON array:
                sw.Write("[");
                for (int i = 0; i < events.Count; ++i)
                {
                    if (i > 0)
                    {
                        sw.Write(',');
                    }
                    sw.Write(events[i]);
                }
                sw.Write("]");

                sw.Flush();
                ms.Position = 0;

                // Send JSON to event hub.
                EventData eventData = new EventData(ms);
                eventHubClient.Send(eventData);
            }
        }
    }
}

```
## Supported JSON shapes
### Sample 1

#### Input

A simple JSON object.

```json
{
    "id":"device1",
    "timestamp":"2016-01-08T01:08:00Z"
}
```
#### Output - one event

|id|timestamp|
|--------|---------------|
|device1|2016-01-08T01:08:00Z|

### Sample 2

#### Input
A JSON array with two JSON objects. Each JSON object will be converted to an event.
```json
[
    {
        "id":"device1",
        "timestamp":"2016-01-08T01:08:00Z"
    },
    {
        "id":"device2",
        "timestamp":"2016-01-17T01:17:00Z"
    }
]
```
#### Output - two events

|id|timestamp|
|--------|---------------|
|device1|2016-01-08T01:08:00Z|
|device2|2016-01-08T01:17:00Z|

### Sample 3

#### Input

A JSON object with a nested JSON array that contains two JSON objects:
```json
{
    "location":"WestUs",
    "events":[
        {
            "id":"device1",
            "timestamp":"2016-01-08T01:08:00Z"
        },
        {
            "id":"device2",
            "timestamp":"2016-01-17T01:17:00Z"
        }
    ]
}

```
#### Output - two events
Notice the property "location" is copied over to each of the event.

|location|events.id|events.timestamp|
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
|WestUs|device1|2016-01-08T01:08:00Z|
|WestUs|device2|2016-01-08T01:17:00Z|

### Sample 4

#### Input

A JSON object with a nested JSON array containing two JSON objects. This input demonstrates that the global properties may be represented by the complex JSON object.

```json
{
    "location":"WestUs",
    "manufacturer":{
        "name":"manufacturer1",
        "location":"EastUs"
    },
    "events":[
        {
            "id":"device1",
            "timestamp":"2016-01-08T01:08:00Z",
            "data":{
                "type":"pressure",
                "units":"psi",
                "value":108.09
            }
        },
        {
            "id":"device2",
            "timestamp":"2016-01-17T01:17:00Z",
            "data":{
                "type":"vibration",
                "units":"abs G",
                "value":217.09
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
#### Output - two events

|location|manufacturer.name|manufacturer.location|events.id|events.timestamp|events.data.type|events.data.units|events.data.value|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|WestUs|manufacturer1|EastUs|device1|2016-01-08T01:08:00Z|pressure|psi|108.09|
|WestUs|manufacturer1|EastUs|device2|2016-01-08T01:17:00Z|vibration|abs G|217.09|
