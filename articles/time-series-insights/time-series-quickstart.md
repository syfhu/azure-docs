# Quickstart: Explore Azure Time Series Insights
This quickstart shows you how to get started with Azure Time Series Insights explorer in a free demonstration environment. You learn how to use your web browser to visualize large volumes of IoT data and tour the key features of the Time Series Insights explorer. 

Azure Time Series Insights is a fully managed analytics, storage, and visualization service that makes it simple to explore and analyze billions of IoT events simultaneously. It gives you a global view of your data, letting you quickly validate your IoT solution and avoid costly downtime to mission-critical devices by helping you discover hidden trends, spot anomalies, and conduct root-cause analyses in near real time.  If you are building an application that needs to store or query time series data, you can develop using the Time Series Insights REST APIs.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.
