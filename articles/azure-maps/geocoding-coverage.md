# Azure Maps geocoding coverage

When you search for a location with Azure Maps, the search service takes your search terms and returns the latitude and longitude coordinates, a process called geocoding. However, Maps does not have the same level of information and accuracy for all regions and countries. Use this article to determine what kind of locations you can reliably search for in each region.
