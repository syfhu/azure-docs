# Persist job and task output

[!INCLUDE [batch-task-output-include](../../includes/batch-task-output-include.md)]

Some common examples of task output include:

- Files created when the task processes input data.
- Log files associated with task execution. 

This article describes various options for persisting task output and the scenarios for which each option is most appropriate.   

## About the Batch File Conventions standard

Batch defines an optional set of conventions for naming task output files in Azure Storage. The [Batch File Conventions standard](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/vs17Dev/src/SDKs/Batch/Support/FileConventions#conventions) describes these conventions. The File Conventions standard determines the names of the destination container and blob path in Azure Storage for a given output file based on the names of the job and task.

It's up to you whether you decide to use the File Conventions standard for naming your output data files. You can also name the destination container and blob however you wish. If you do use the File Conventions standard for naming output files, then your output files are available for viewing in the [Azure portal][portal].

There are a few different ways that you can use the File Conventions standard:

- If you are using the Batch service API to persist output files, you can choose to name destination containers and blobs according to the File Conventions standard. The Batch service API enables you to persist output files from client code, without modifying your task application.
- If you are developing with .NET, you can use the [Azure Batch File Conventions library for .NET][nuget_package]. An advantage of using this library is that it supports querying your output files according to their ID or purpose. The built-in querying functionality makes it easy to access output files from a client application or from other tasks. However, your task application must be modified to call File Conventions library. For more information, see the reference for the [File Conventions library for .NET](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.azure.batch.conventions.files.aspx).
- If you are developing with a language other than .NET, you can implement the File Conventions standard in your application.

## Design considerations for persisting output 

When designing your Batch solution, consider the following factors related to job and task outputs.

* **Compute node lifetime**: Compute nodes are often transient, especially in autoscale-enabled pools. Output from a task that runs on a node is available only while the node exists, and only within the file retention period you've set for the task. If a task produces output that may be needed after the task is complete, then the task must upload its output files to a durable store such as Azure Storage.

* **Output storage**: Azure Storage is recommended as a data store for task output, but you can use any durable storage. Writing task output to Azure Storage is integrated into the Batch service API. If you use another form of durable storage, you'll need to write the application logic to persist task output yourself.   

* **Output retrieval**: You can retrieve task output directly from the compute nodes in your pool, or from Azure Storage or another data store if you have persisted task output. To retrieve a task's output directly from a compute node, you need the file name and its output location on the node. If you persist task output to Azure Storage, then you need the full path to the file in Azure Storage to download the output files with the Azure Storage SDK.

* **Viewing output**: When you navigate to a Batch task in the Azure portal and select **Files on node**, you are presented with all files associated with the task, not just the output files you're interested in. Again, files on compute nodes are available only while the node exists and only within the file retention time you've set for the task. To view task output that you've persisted to Azure Storage, you can use the Azure portal or an Azure Storage client application such as the [Azure Storage Explorer][storage_explorer]. To view output data in Azure Storage with the portal or another tool, you must know the file's location and navigate to it directly.

## Options for persisting output

Depending on your scenario, there are a few different approaches you can take to persist task output:

- Use the Batch service API.  
- Use the Batch File Conventions library for .NET.  
- Implement the Batch File Conventions standard in your application.
- Implement a custom file movement solution.

The following sections describe each approach in more detail.

### Use the Batch service API

With version 2017-05-01, the Batch service adds support for specifying output files in Azure Storage for task data when you [add a task to a job](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/batchservice/add-a-task-to-a-job) or [add a collection of tasks to a job](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/batchservice/add-a-collection-of-tasks-to-a-job).

The Batch service API supports persisting task data to an Azure Storage account from pools created with the virtual machine configuration. With the Batch service API, you can persist task data without modifying the application that your task runs. You can optionally adhere to the [Batch File Conventions standard](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/vs17Dev/src/SDKs/Batch/Support/FileConventions#conventions) for naming the files that you persist to Azure Storage. 

Use the Batch service API to persist task output when:

- You want to persist data from Batch tasks and job manager tasks in pools created with the virtual machine configuration.
- You want to persist data to an Azure Storage container with an arbitrary name.
- You want to persist data to an Azure Storage container named according to the [Batch File Conventions standard](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/vs17Dev/src/SDKs/Batch/Support/FileConventions#conventions). 

> [!NOTE]
> The Batch service API does not support persisting data from tasks running in pools created with the cloud service configuration. For information about persisting task output from pools running the cloud services configuration, see [Persist job and task data to Azure Storage with the Batch File Conventions library for .NET to persist ](batch-task-output-file-conventions.md)
> 
> 

For more information on persisting task output with the Batch service API, see [Persist task data to Azure Storage with the Batch service API](batch-task-output-files.md). Also see the [PersistOutputs][github_persistoutputs] sample project on GitHub, which demonstrates how to use the Batch client library for .NET to persist task output to durable storage.

### Use the Batch File Conventions library for .NET

Developers building Batch solutions with C# and .NET can use the [File Conventions library for .NET][nuget_package] to persist task data to an Azure Storage account, according to the [Batch File Conventions standard](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/vs17Dev/src/SDKs/Batch/Support/FileConventions#conventions). The File Conventions library handles moving output files to Azure Storage and naming destination containers and blobs in a well-known way.

The File Conventions library supports querying output files by either ID or purpose, making it easy to locate them without needing the complete file URIs. 

Use the Batch File Conventions library for .NET to persist task output when:

- You want to stream data to Azure Storage while the task is still running.
- You want to persist data from pools created with either the cloud service configuration or the virtual machine configuration.
- Your client application or other tasks in the job needs to locate and download task output files by ID or by purpose. 
- You want to perform check-pointing or early upload of initial results.
- You want to view task output in the Azure portal.

For more information on persisting task output with the File Conventions library for .NET, see [Persist job and task data to Azure Storage with the Batch File Conventions library for .NET to persist ](batch-task-output-file-conventions.md). Also see the [PersistOutputs][github_persistoutputs] sample project on GitHub, which demonstrates how to use the File Conventions library for .NET to persist task output to durable storage.

The [PersistOutputs][github_persistoutputs] sample project on GitHub demonstrates how to use the Batch client library for .NET to persist task output to durable storage.

### Implement the Batch File Conventions standard

If you are using a language other than .NET, you can implement the [Batch File Conventions standard](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/vs17Dev/src/SDKs/Batch/Support/FileConventions#conventions) in your own application. 

You may want to implement the File Conventions naming standard yourself when you want a proven naming scheme, or when you want to view task output in the Azure portal.

### Implement a custom file movement solution

You can also implement your own complete file movement solution. Use this approach when:

- You want to persist task data to a data store other than Azure Storage. To upload files to a data store like Azure SQL or Azure DataLake, you can create a custom script or executable to upload to that location. You can then call it on the command line after running your primary executable. For example, on a Windows node, you might call these two commands: `doMyWork.exe && uploadMyFilesToSql.exe`
- You want to perform check-pointing or early upload of initial results.
- You want to maintain granular control over error handling. For example, you may want to implement your own solution if you want to use task dependency actions to take certain upload actions based on specific task exit codes. For more information on task dependency actions, see [Create task dependencies to run tasks that depend on other tasks](batch-task-dependencies.md).
