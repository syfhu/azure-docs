# Billing Options  

## Commercial Considerations on the marketplace  
The marketplace does not share revenue for the following listing types.  
*   List  
*   Trial  
*   Transact using the Bring Your Own License (BYOL) billing model

You are not billed additional fees for participating in the storefronts on the marketplace.  
*   For more information, visit the Azure Marketplace Participation Policies page located at [azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/marketplace/participation-policies](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/marketplace/participation-policies).  

## Pay-As-You-Go and Bring Your Own License Billing Options  
When you use a Pay-As-You-Go billing model as a publishing option, your usage-based software licensing revenue is shared 80/20 between you and Microsoft. A single offer may be priced using both Pay-As-You-Go and BYOL billing models. The two billing models coexist at the offer level as separate SKUs. You configure the billing models in your offer on Cloud Partner Portal. 

Consider the following examples.  
*   If you enable the Pay-As-You-Go option, then you have the following result.  
    | Your license cost | $1.00 per hour |  
    |:--- |:--- |  
    | Azure usage cost (D1/1-Core) | $0.14 per hour |  
    | *Customer is billed by Microsoft* | *$1.14 per hour* |  

    In this scenario, Microsoft bills $1.14 per hour for use of your published VM image.  
    | Microsoft bills | $1.14 per hour |  
    |:--- |:--- |  
    | Microsoft pays you 80% of your license cost | $0.80 per hour |  
    | Microsoft keeps 20% of your license cost | $0.20 per hour |  
    | Microsoft keeps the Azure usage cost | $0.14 per hour |  

*   If you enable the BYOL option, then you have the following result.  
    | Your license cost | License fee negotiated and billed by you |  
    |:--- |:--- |  
    | Azure usage cost (D1/1-Core) | $0.14 per hour |  
    | *Customer is billed by Microsoft* | *$0.14 per hour* |  

    In this scenario, Microsoft bills $0.14 per hour for use of your published VM image.  
    | Microsoft bills | $0.14 per hour |  
    |:--- |:--- |  
    | Microsoft keeps the Azure usage cost | $0.14 per hour |  
    | Microsoft keeps 0% of your license cost | $0.00 per hour |  

## Single-billing and Payment Methods  
An important benefit of using the Transact listing option is that your licensing costs and Azure usage are single-billed directly to your customer.  

In the scenario, Microsoft bills and collects on your behalf. Microsoft billing removes the requirement for you to create your own procurement relationship with your customer. Single-billing may save you time and resources. Single-billing may help you to focus on landing the sale, rather than collecting the bill. 

## Enterprise Agreement  
If you are an Enterprise Agreement (EA) customer with Microsoft, then you may use your EA to pay for Microsoft products. You may bill products including your Azure usage. Using your EA to pay is designed for organizations that want to license software and cloud services for three or more years. You spread out payments instead of one making up-front payment. If you use Pay-As-You-Go transact listing type, then the billing for your software licensing costs follows the quarterly EA overage billing cycle.  

### Monetary Commitment  
If you are an EA customer, then you may add Azure to your agreement. You add Azure to your agreement by making an upfront monetary commitment to Azure. Your monetary commitment is consumed throughout the year. Your commitment includes any combination of usage of the wide variety of services in Azure.
