# Build Your Landing Page  
A landing page on your company website is a gateway from your demand generation activities to your listing on the marketplace.  

Begin by identifying your goals. For your solutions, choose your target customer and the action for your customer to take.  Your solution may include the following actions.  
*   Test drive the solution  
*   Get a solution now  
*   and more...  

You may reference your landing page across multiple marketing tactics. You may use the marketing tactics.  
*   Events  
*   Webcasts  
*   Social media  
*   White papers  
*   Technical training sessions  
*   Press releases  

The more consistent you are in your messaging and your call-to-action, the easier for your customers to find your solution.  

When you have a campaign plan ready, create your landing page. Review the following table to maximize the effectiveness of your landing page.  

| Best practice | What to avoid |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| ***Communicate what customer problem your solution solves, and how Azure to makes it happen*** |  Not communicating the ways in which your solution works with Azure. |  
| ***Create a short, easy-to-remember URL*** | Using long URLs. Long URLs are not memorable and are hard to locate. |  
| ***Add relevant visual content, like a customer testimonial video or a solution architecture*** | Using too much text causes your customers to ignore your content and stop exploring. |  
| ***Create a clear call to action to direct visitors to your Marketplace catalog page*** | Having too many links or actions on the page. |  
| ***Put your call-to-action in a header or a clearly delineated section*** |  Embedding the links to your listing on the marketplace in a paragraph of text. |  
| ***Research the best keywords and optimize the page for search*** | Assuming that your product name generates higher search rankings. |  
| ***Use keywords from your advertising campaigns*** |  Using many different keywords across your web properties dilutes your advertising investments. |  
| ***Put relevant product names and keywords `above the fold`*** | Making users scroll to see the product or solution that you are showcasing. |  
| ***Use brand imagery to validate your solution in accordance with Microsoft branding guidelines,<br />such as Azure Certified*** | Using Microsoft brand imagery that is not approved. |
