# Azure Marketplace Consulting Services
Consulting Services in Azure Marketplace provides Microsoft partners the goal of connecting customers with services to support and extend their use of Azure. The Azure Marketplace supports the listing of consulting-service offerings from System Integrator (SI) partners of Microsoft. 

These consulting-service offerings are customer-specific engagements. They're fixed in scope and duration, can be fixed-price or free, and have a defined outcome. Potential customers can easily request to be contacted by partners. Partners receive a notification in their CRM system, and they aim to respond to requests within 48 hours.

## Consulting Services in Azure Marketplace vs AppSource Storefront
The marketplace storefronts are aligned with audiences and Microsoft cloud products to help customers find what they need. Each storefront offers specialized publishing options to help you maximize your publishing investment. The following table summarizes these options:

|         |Azure Marketplace  |AppSource |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Audience  	|IT Pros and Cloud Developers|Business Users / Line-of-Business decision makers|
|Solution Relevance  	|Technical apps built for or built on Azure|Business Apps That Leverage / Extend D365, Power BI, O365, Azure. (Add-in or Add-on finished apps)|
|Publishing Options  	|Contact me, Trial, Transact, or Consulting Services|Contact Me, Trial, or Consulting Services|
|In Product Experience  	|Azure Management Portal|Dynamics 365, Office 365, Office Client Apps| 
|Other  	|On-Premises Publishing Via Azure Stack|Consulting Services for Dynamics and Power BI|

Consulting Services in Azure Marketplace should leverage offerings geared towards a technical audience with focuses on Azure technical solutions and services.


Service offers that are based on Microsoft Dynamics 365, Office 365, and Power BI are eligible to be listed on AppSource. For more information, see [Microsoft AppSource consulting services listing guidelines](https://smp-cdn-prod.azureedge.net/documents/Microsoft%20AppSource%20Partner%20Listing%20Guidelines.pdf).

To publish to the Azure Marketplace storefront, you will make this selection by choosing "Azure" from the "Primary Product" drop-down menu in the Cloud Partner Portal. To publish to AppSource, you will make this selection by choosing "Dynamics 365," "Power BI," or "Power Apps" from the "Primary Product" drop-down menu in the Cloud Partner Portal.

## Eligible Partners and Supported Countries

Partners are also required to have a **silver or gold competency** in the relevant area for their service. The eligible competencies are listed in the following table:

|Competency  |Solution area  |

## Prepare Your Publishing Artifacts
Even before you nominate your service, you can start collecting and preparing the content that will help your listing articulate the value of your service and solution to your target customer.

## Publishing Process
Listing your consulting-service offer on the Azure Marketplace involves the following stages:

1. **Request**: To send your request, use the [Azure Marketplace Nomination Form](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/sell/nominate) and tell us more about your organization. 
Note: Publishers will only need to submit nomination process once to list on either Azure Marketplace or AppSource. Once nomination and onboarding process has been completed, a Cloud Partner Portal will be created where publishers can create and submit their offer listings.
2. **Validation**: Your request is reviewed to ensure that you meet the eligibility criteria. We then send you instructions for listing your consulting services offering. 
3. **Submit**: Provide the required information that's listed in the instructions. All content and supporting material must be submitted in English. 
4. **Review**: Our marketing and editorial team reviews your submission and optimizes it for readability, grammar, and effectiveness. 
5. **Staging**: Your submission is staged for your review. 
6. **Publishing**: When you and Microsoft are satisfied with the staged content, your listing is ready to go live on the Azure Marketplace. The go-live date for your listing depends on the country that's specified in your offering. If the catalog for your selected country is already live on the Azure Marketplace, your listing will appear within a few hours. Otherwise, the listing will appear as soon as the catalog goes live.

## Offer Listings and Content Review Criteria
Offerings must be of one of the following five service types (you can list more than one): 

* **Assessment**: An evaluation of a customer’s environment to determine the applicability of a solution and provide an estimate of cost and timing. 
* **Briefing**: An introduction to a solution or a consulting service to draw customer interest by using frameworks, demos, and customer examples. 
* **Implementation**: A complete installation that results in a fully working solution. We recommend limiting it to solutions that can be implemented in two weeks or less. 
* **Proof of concept**: A limited-scope implementation to determine whether a solution meets customer requirements. 
* **Workshop**: An interactive engagement that's conducted on a customer’s premises. It can involve training, briefings, assessments, or demos that are built on the customer’s data or environment. 

Note: Except for the *Briefing* service type, consulting services can be offered in-person (that is, onsite at a customer’s location or a partner’s facility) or virtually (that is, via teleconferencing, web conferencing, or remote implementation). Briefings must be offered in person.

Once you have configured the required elements listed above, the content review team will validate that your offer description is informative and complete for your target audience. 

#### Listing Title

Note that the title field has a 50-character limit and must transmit the duration and service type of the offer. This is to maximize search engine optimization. The required format is as follows: NAME : DURATION TYPE

Examples:

|Workshop on Smart Toasters        |  Smart Toasters: 1-Wk Workshop       |
|  SQL Server Migration PoC    | SQL Migration: 3-Wk Proof of Concept        |
