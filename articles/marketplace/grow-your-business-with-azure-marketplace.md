# Grow your business with Azure Marketplace  
After you have developed the technical assets for your Azure Marketplace listing, you are able to increase the number of users coming to your offer and the growth in usage of your product by following marketing best practices. 

>[!NOTE]
>To learn about the publishing process and technical requirements, read the [Azure Marketplace and AppSource publishing guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/marketplace-publishers-guide).

## How marketing helps  
Following best practices in marketing hlps to set you up for success with go-to-market and Microsoft Co-Sell initiatives. It also maximizes your business benefits through the marketplace. The Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) is your gateway for all marketing and programmatic resources related to the storefronts on the marketplace. 

The quality of your offer and your commitment to customer-centric demand generation and partner engagement help drive customer growth for your business. Engaging in these activities helps Microsoft amplify go-to-market work and feature key solutions across the storefronts on the marketplace. 

Use the following list to review the marketing practices for your offer.  
*   You optimized your listing to drive traffic and engagement.  
*   You created messaging on my website, and created a unique landing page, to drive traffic to your offer on the marketplace.  
*   You published a test drive or other trial so that customers are able to experience your offer running live on Azure.  
*   You planned and built my own marketing and promotion campaigns to drive awareness and engagement.  
*   You enabled on-demand lead generation so that every time your customer acts to test or deploy your offer, you receive the name and contact information of your customer.  
*   You learned about and connected with the partner resources that are available to you through the MPN.  
    *   For more information about the MPN, visit the Membership Overview page located at [partner.microsoft.com/membership](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership).  

### Create a great listing  
Your listing on the marketplace may be your first interaction with a potential customer. Like any first impression, you want to make it strong and something your audience wants to follow up on. There are some basic things you are able to do to help make this first impression in the Marketplace great:

| impression | detail |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| Be found | Write the description for your offer using keywords and terms with which your customers search.  |  
| Be visual | Images and videos help show users your key features and may help illustrate your experience. Think about what you may display that helps deliver your value proposition or answer the top questions from your customers. |  
| Provide an experience | Customers like to try before they buy. Leads generated from demos, trials, and test drives result in more customer deals. The stronger the trial experience that you provide, the stronger the lead you generate. Microsoft has found that test drive leads result (on average) in 40 percent closed deals. |  
| Help your audience learn | Though Microsoft encourages you to keep your overview space clear and simple, there is plenty of room to point to additional resources about your product. Use this space to deliver the concise message about what your product does and how it is a fit for the needs of your customer. Do not be afraid to direct your customer to additional materials to learn more. It is a bonus if these learning materials or links may track into your content marketing strategy, so you are able to consistently nurture leads. |  
| Take advantage of ratings and reviews | Let your customers sell your product for you. Customer advocacy may be the biggest driver of sales and is often where buyers go before they learn more about your product. Having multiple strong reviews also helps bump up your offer in search results and into key featured areas. |  

### Promote your new offer  

#### Build an effective marketing campaign  
A marketing campaign is a series of promotional activities or marketing tactics aimed at driving your audience to a desired action or outcome. Before you design your campaign, you should do the following.

##### Know your audience  
First, verify who is the buyer and who is the influencer. Your tactics and calls to action for each group might differ. Ask these evaluation questions:  
*   How much control does the buyer have over the purchasing decision? 
*   How much influence does the influencer have? 
*   What does the influencer influence? 
*   Do they influence budget or which solution is picked? 

Knowing the answers to these questions helps you make decisions about where to invest your money and how to distribute your money.

##### Define where your audience learns  
Buyers are 90 percent of the way through their journey by the time they visit a marketplace. Buyers get this far along in the decision-making process by learning about solutions and assessing options in advance. You want to design a campaign that aims to be where your buyers and influencers learn. 

Every audience for each industry, vertical, or category is different. Does your audience learn online, through email, at trade shows, through social media, or through conversations with trusted advisors? Depending on where and how your audience learns, you should design activities and distribute your marketing dollars accordingly. The combination of these tactics becomes your campaign strategy.

#### Create clear campaign goals  
You should define success for your campaign on the marketplace and create clear KPIs. You might run multiple campaigns with different end goals. You and Microsoft want to grow sales. The ultimate end goal is increased revenue or customer acquisition. However, your marketing campaigns might be tied to goals at other stages of the buying cycle.

For instance, if you have newly launched your product in the Marketplace, you might find that your focus is best spent on audience education and lead generation. Success might be defined by the number of leads generated from your Marketplace listing. In this case, your marketing tactics (and landing page) would focus on drawing customers to your Marketplace listing.

If you have a trial set up in the Marketplace and you know that your product requires some level of engagement and experience before purchase, you might make your campaign goal the number of trials downloaded. In this case, the CTA for your campaign tactics would focus sharply on encouraging a trial in the Marketplace. 

If your product or category is well known and you have purchase capabilities set up in the Marketplace, you might decide to skip the trial step and direct your audience to your "buy now" link in the Marketplace.

At a more mature point in the history of your offer, you might decide to focus your campaign efforts on upselling your customer base and drive action toward increased purchase in the Marketplace. Your tactics would focus on encouraging customers to "buy now" in the Marketplace. Your KPI might be the revenue generated through the Marketplace.

Whatever the maturity of your offer and the goals of your organization, the following are keys to maximizing the effectiveness of your campaign.

*   Staying focused on this goal
*   Mapping out a set of integrated marketing tactics aligned to this goal

#### Invest in merchandising  
As part of the publishing process, you should consider what type of offer to create and choose a category for your offer in Azure Marketplace. Make sure you select a category that is accurate for your solution so that it is displayed accurately to potential customers.  

In the Azure Marketplace, you become eligible for featured offers when you select trial or transact listing type. 
*   For more information about how featured offers fit in the context of your go-to-market benefits, visit the GTM Benefits on the marketplace page located at [gtm-benefits](./gtm-benefits.md).  

Featured offers are chosen based on which offers provide the best customer experience for your customers and take advantage of high-quality partner marketing engagement. The following criteria define featured offers.  
*   Clarity of the listing.  
*   Reliability of the technology.  
*   Growth of platform usage by your customers.  
*   Your level of engagement with creating high-quality marketing material.  

To maximize the chances that your offer is featured, you should invest in the success of your Marketplace offering. Consider the following approaches to ensure a great customer experience for your offer.  
*   Ensure that your marketing artifacts are uploaded and displaying correctly.  
*   Join the Microsoft Partner Network and engage with the partner ecosystem.  
    *   For more information about MPN, visit the Microsoft Partner Network page located at [partner.microsoft.com/membership](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership).
*   Drive high-quality traffic to your offer in Azure Marketplace by creating high-quality demand generation campaigns.  
*   Ensure that all of your offers are available in Azure Marketplace.  
*   Grow the consumption of your Azure Marketplace offers by driving demand, providing high-quality customer service, and providing timely updates on your offer.  

## Analytics and reporting  
In the Insights section of the Cloud Partner Portal, you see a high-level performance overview for your offer. The following reports are included in this section.  
*   Summary snapshot of orders  
*   Usage  
*   Deployments  
*   Customer trends on the Insights home page  
*   Detailed orders, usage, and customer data  
*   Orders and usage shown as a monthly summary or as a six-month trend view  
*   Usage and orders sliced by several criteria  

Detailed reports show customer information, like company name and geographic location down to the postal code. You should use this information to compare your customers and compensate your sellers. Microsoft provides the following specific attributes about your customers.  
*   Reseller   
*   First Name  
*   Last Name  
*   Email  
*   Company Name  
*   Transaction Date  
*   Subscription Name  
*   Azure Subscription ID (PAYG customers only)  
*   Cloud Instance Name  
*   Order Count  
*   Customer Country Region  
*   Customer City  
*   Customer Communication Culture  
*   Customer Zip Code  

The best practice for the information in these reports is to reconcile it with your internal data. Use it to help prioritize your marketing campaign actions.  

The Analytics section of Cloud Partner Portal Insights provides a rich dashboard based on Power BI. You are able to use this dashboard to see traffic on the detail page of your offer. New features for this dashboard are rolled out in an ongoing way.  

Also in the Cloud Partner Portal is documentation on Microsoft Campaigns. You may use the Microsoft Campaigns documentation to set up your campaign and track your campaign on the Cloud Partner Portal.
