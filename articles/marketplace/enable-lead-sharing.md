# Enable lead sharing  
Ensure that lead management is enabled for your listing on the marketplace, so that you receive the contact information for the following audiences.

| storefront | audience |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| AppSource | business customers |  
| Azure Marketplace | customers |  

Your leads provide the basis of outreach for the following campaigns, sales motions by your field sales staff, and information about how your app or offer is performing. 

| storefront | campaign |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| AppSource | nurture |  
| Azure Marketplace | in-demand generation |  

Use the following practices for your leads.  
*   Qualifying your leads and scoring the leads as sales opportunities
*   Nurturing your leads to enter a sales pipeline
*   Aligning your efforts with your overall marketing campaign strategy 

Your leads demonstrate customer interest in the following listing. 

| storefront | listing |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| AppSource | <table> <tr><td>App</td></tr> <tr><td>Consulting service</td></tr> </table> |  
| Azure Marketplace | <table> <tr><td>Offer</td></tr> <tr><td>Technology</td></tr> </table> |  

You should have a process in place to follow up with your leads.  

| storefront | leads |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| AppSource | <table> <tr><td>your CRM</td></tr> <tr><td>Microsoft field seller CRM</td></tr> </table> |  
| Azure Marketplace | <table> <tr><td>Azure Marketplace</td></tr> <tr><td>Microsoft field seller CRM</td></tr> </table> |  

Your leads in the storefronts on the marketplace are different from Microsoft seller-qualified leads that are a feature of the Co-Sell program.  
*   For more information about how to access the Co-Sell program, visit the Promote Your Business with Microsoft page located at [promote-your-business-with-microsoft](./promote-your-business-with-microsoft.md).  

## Next steps
*   Visit the [Azure Marketplace and AppSource Publisher Guide](./marketplace-publishers-guide.md) page.
